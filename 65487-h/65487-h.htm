<h2><span>CHAPTER I.</span> <span class="smaller">THE CRY FOR HELP.</span></h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">To the Commandant at Fort Adams</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake send us help at once. We have been
fighting the Comanches for two days; half our men are killed
and wounded, and we can not hold out much longer. But
we have women and children with us, and we shall fight to
the last and die game. Send help without an hour&#8217;s delay,
or it&#8217;s all up.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">J. T. Shields.</span>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Covered with dust, and reeking with sweat, with bloody
nostril and dilated eye, the black mustang thundered up to
the gate of the fort, staggered as if drunken, and then with
a wheezing moan, shivered from nose to hoof, and with an
awful cry, like that of a dying person, his flanks heaved and
he dropped dead to the ground, his lithe, sinewy rider leaping
from the saddle, just in time to escape being crushed to
death.</p>

<p>Scarcely less frightful and alarming was the appearance of
the horseman, so covered with dust and grime, that no one
could tell whether he was Indian, African or Caucasian; but,
whoever he was, he showed that he was alive to the situation,
by running straight through the gate of the stockades, into
the parade-ground, where, pausing in a bewildered sort of
way, he glanced hurriedly around, and then shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the commandant? Quick! some one tell me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Greaves chanced to be standing at that moment in
converse with a couple of his officers, and upon hearing the
cry, he moved toward the stranger with a rapid tread, but
with a certain dignified deliberation that always marked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
movements. Knowing him to be the man for whom he was
searching, the messenger did not wait for him to approach,
but fairly bounded toward him, and thrusting a piece of dirty
paper, scrawled over with lead pencil, looked imploringly in his
face, while he read the words given above.</p>

<p>And as the colonel read, his brows knitted and his face
paled. He felt the urgency of that despairing appeal, and
he saw the almost utter impossibility of complying with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;When was this written?&#8221; he asked, of the dust-begrimed
courier.</p>

<p>&#8220;At daybreak this morning,&#8221; was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far away are your friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty miles as the crow flies, and I have never drawn
rein since my horse started, till he fell dead just outside the
gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many men are there in this fix?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There were twenty men, and a dozen women and children.
When I left, about half that number were alive, and whether
any are still living, God only knows, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it is not as bad as that,&#8221; said the colonel, again
glancing at the paper, and involuntarily sighing, for despite
his schooling upon the frontier, he felt keenly the anguish of
this wail, that was borne to him across the sad prairie. &#8220;Not
as bad as that, I trust; for if they have held out two days,
we may hope that they are able to hold out still longer. But
how is it that <i>you</i> succeeded in reaching us, when they could
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Feeling that some explanation was expected of him, the
messenger spoke hurriedly, but as calmly as possible:</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty of us were conveying a party of women and
children&mdash;the families of merchants and officers at Santa Fe&mdash;through
the Indian country, on our way to that city, when
the Comanches came down on us, in a swarm of hundreds,
and finding there was no escaping a fight, we ran our wagons
in a circle, shut the women and horses inside, and then it
seemed as if hell was let loose upon us. Yelling, shouting,
screeching, charging was kept up all that day into the night.
We picked off the red devils with every shot, but the more
we killed the thicker they came, seeming to spring up from
the very ground, until the prairie was covered with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
At night we had a little rest, and we thought perhaps they
would draw off and let us alone. Why they didn&#8217;t make a
charge upon our camp that night, I can not tell; but they
only sent a few stray shots, more than one of which was fatal,
and at daylight the fun began again, and never stopped till
the sun went down, when there wasn&#8217;t much of a pause then.
That was yesterday, and we had it all through the night, and
since we halted the day before yesterday, there hasn&#8217;t been a
drop of water for horse, man, woman or child, so that you
can see what an awful strait they are in.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time quite a group had gathered about the messenger,
enchained by the thrilling tale he told, the truth of
which was so eloquently attested by his manner and appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t told us how <i>you</i> got here,&#8221; reminded the
colonel, as the man paused for a moment. &#8220;<i>You</i> have succeeded
at least in insuring your safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We made up our minds about midnight last night that
something of the kind had to be done, as it was our only
hope. Two of our men tried to steal through, crawling on
hands and knees, but both were caught within a hundred
yards of the camp&mdash;one shot dead, and the other so badly
tomahawked, that he died within an hour of getting back to
us. So I told Shields to let me have his mustang, which is
the fleetest creature on the plains, and I would either get
through or do as the others did. So, just about daybreak, I
crammed that slip of paper in the side of my shoe, stretched
out flat on the mustang&#8217;s back and give him the word. Away
he went like a thunderbolt, with the rifles cracking all about
my ears, and the Comanche thundering down upon me like
so many bloodhounds. I fell more than one bullet in my
legs, and I knew the horse was hurt pretty bad&mdash;it didn&#8217;t
hinder his going, and the noble fellow kept straight along till
he brought me here. But you act as if you didn&#8217;t know
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Know you?&#8221; repeated the amazed colonel. &#8220;I never
saw you before.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<h2><span>CHAPTER II.</span> <span class="smaller">THE ANSWER.</span></h2>

<p>The powdered, begrimed face was seen to expand into
something like a grin, and raising his hand, the courier literally
scraped the dust from his cheeks and eyebrows, and then,
as he removed his hat, a general exclamation of amazement
escaped all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim Gibbons! is it you?&#8221; called out the commandant,
as he recognized a man who had been employed at his fort
a year before. &#8220;I thought your voice had a familiar sound,
but then your own mother would not have recognized you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But come,&#8221; added Gibbons, moving about uneasily, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
talk over this matter some other time. I&#8217;ve brought you
the message, colonel,&#8221; he added, making a graceful military
salute. &#8220;I had heard in St. Louis that you had been sent to
another command, else I would have known whom to ask
for. Now, can you help us or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer folded his arms behind his back and walked
slowly over the parade-ground, signifying by a nod of his
head, that Gibbons should do the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>must</i> help you,&#8221; he said, in a low voice; &#8220;such a call
as that can not pass unheeded. But, Jim, you see my fix.
We ought to have a full regiment to garrison this fort, and
the Government allows me but six hundred. Two hundred
of these men are on a scout up toward the mountains, and
won&#8217;t be in till dark. Do you know there is some reason to
fear an attack upon the fort, from a combination of several
tribes under the direction of the infernal Comanche, Swico-Cheque?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why he is at the head of the devils that have our friends
walled in. I know him too well, and have seen him a dozen
times, circling around on his horse, yelling like a thousand
panthers, and tiring about a dozen shots a minute. I have
fired at him five or six times, but never grazed him once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think it is more than likely that we shall have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
attack from him. Now, you know something of life on the
plains; tell me how many men you need to bring your
friends into the fort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to have a hundred, at the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to have five hundred at the smallest calculation.
I tell you the Indians in this part of the country are
among the best fighters and hunters in the world, and if I
send a hundred men out into the country, where they are
sure to come against old Swico and his band, the chances are
that they will all be served as were Colonel Fetterman&#8217;s men
at Fort Phil Kearney, a month or two ago. You know that
over a hundred of them went out, and never a one was ever
seen alive again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, if I understand that matter right,&#8221; replied Gibbons,
who was becoming impatient and uneasy at the delay, &#8220;these
men were entrapped and massacred; I don&#8217;t think there is
any likelihood of that in our case. But, colonel, pardon me;
I wish to know your decision, either one way or the other, at
once. If you conclude that you can not spare a hundred
men to go forty miles away to help this party, then let me
have a fresh horse. I will return, sail in and go under with
the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Gibbons attested the earnestness of what he said, by
starting to move away; but Colonel Greaves caught his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on! you shall have the men you need. I have
been trying ever since I heard your story to decide whether
I ought to risk the safety of a hundred men to save one-tenth
that number; but I can&#8217;t think. It seems to me that I hear
the wailing cry of those women and children coming over
the prairie, and if I should turn my back upon them, their
voices and moans would follow me ever afterward in my
waking and sleeping hours. Yes, Jim, you shall have the
hundred men. I will lead them myself, and we will make
hot work in that gulch before we get through.&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel, having made his decision, did not hesitate for
a moment. Turning sharply upon his heel, he beckoned to
the adjutant, and gave him peremptory orders to make ready
a hundred men for a scout into the Indian country. They
were to be armed with rifle, revolver and cavalry swords, and
to be mounted on the best horses at the fort.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>As he turned about to say a few words to Gibbons, he saw
the tears making furrows down his grimy cheeks. He attempted
to speak, but for a few seconds was unable to articulate.
Taking the hand of the colonel, he finally said, in a
choking voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, colonel, and God grant that this may not be
too late. Oh, if you could have seen those pleading faces of
the women, those cries of the helpless children for one swallow
of water, the dead bodies of the men, that we had drawn
in behind the wagons out of reach of the red-skins, and the
screeching devils all around, you would send your whole garrison
to their rescue. Where is Lightning Jo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He went out with the scouting party this morning, and
that is what caused me to hesitate about sending the company
to the help of your friends. I always feel tolerably
comfortable when I know that he is at the head of the
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the bustle of hurried preparation was going on
within the fort, Gibbons accompanied the colonel to his lodgings,
where he washed the dust from his person, partook of
water and refreshments and explained more in detail the
particulars of the misfortune of his friends. He was equally
desirous that the wonderful scout, Lightning Jo, should lead
the partly, as he was a host of himself, and having lived from
earliest childhood in the south-west, he was as thorough an
Indian as the great chieftain, Swico-Cheque himself, and the
daring Comanches held him in greater terror than any other
living personage.</p>

<p>But the case was one that admitted of no delay&mdash;even if
it was certain that Jo would be in at the end of an hour.
Half that time might decide the fate of the little Spartan
band struggling so bravely in Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch, and the release
of the beleaguered ones was now the question above all
others.</p>

<p>It required but a very short time for the party to complete
their preparations. Out of the seemingly inextricable confusion
of stamping horses, and men running hither and
thither, all at once appeared full one hundred men, mounted,
armed and officered precisely as they had been directed.</p>

<p>An orderly stood holding the horse of Colonel Greaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
until he was ready to mount, while another was at Gibbons&#8217;
disposal.</p>

<p>The next moment the two latter had leaped into their
saddles, and placing themselves at the head of the cavalcade,
rode out of the stockade upon the open prairie, which had
scarcely been done, when a new and most gratifying surprise
awaited them. The march was instantly halted, and the face
of Colonel Greaves and of Gibbons lit up with pleasure.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER III.</span> <span class="smaller">LIGHTNING JO.</span></h2>

<p>That which arrested the attention of the company riding
out of the stockade of Fort Adams, was the sight of another
party of horsemen coming through a range of hills about
half a mile distant, one glance only being sufficient to identify
them as the scouts already referred to as being under the
guidance and leadership of the great western celebrity, Lightning
Jo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s what I call lucky,&#8221; exclaimed Colonel
Greaves. &#8220;Jo is the very man of all others that we need.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horsemen rode down the declivity at an easy gallop,
and shortly reined up in front of the stockade, with a graceful
salute, and an action that indicated that he awaited the
commands of his superior officer.</p>

<p>The scouts, or hunters, had turned their time to good account,
as was shown by a number of buffalo carcasses, or
rather the choice portions of such, supported across the saddles
of their animals; the appearance of the beasts, too, indicated
that many of them had been subjected to the hardest
kind of riding.</p>

<p>A few words explained to Lightning Jo the business about
to be undertaken, and he at once assumed his position as
leader of the company that had just prepared to start, the
colonel withdrawing into the fort again, where it was his
manifest duty to remain, while the desperate attempt to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>relieve
the beleaguered party in Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch was being
made.</p>

<p>The scout did not take a fresh horse, and when pressed to
do so, he declared that his mustang was as capable of a fifty
mile tramp, as he was upon the morning he started upon the
hunt from which he had just returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, boys! business is business,&#8221; said he, in his crisp,
sharp tone, as his steed carried him by one or two bounds
to the head of the cavalcade he was to lead. &#8220;Come, Gibbons,
keep yer place alongside me, and yer can explain as we
ride along.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as the company of brave men gallop to the southward
on their errand of mercy, each man a hero, and all with set
teeth and an unalterable determination in their hearts to do
all that mortal man could do to save the despairing little
band that had sent its wail of anguish across the prairie, we
will improve the occasion by glancing at the remarkable man
who acted as their leader.</p>

<p>Lightning Jo had gained his appellation from the wonderful
quickness of his movements, and his almost miraculous
skill as a scout. His celerity of movement was incredible,
while his equally astonishing strength excited the wonder of
the most famous bordermen of the day. It was a well established
fact that Lightning Jo, a couple of years before, at
Fort Laramie, had been forced into a personal encounter with
a badgering pugilist, who was on his return to the States
from California, and who had the reputation of being one of
the most scientific hitters that had ever entered the prize
ring, and who on the occasion referred to was so completely
polished off by Jo, that he lay a month at the fort before he
recovered from his injuries.</p>

<p>It was said, and there was every reason to believe it, that
he was capable of running miles with the speed of the swiftest
mustang of the prairie; that he had traversed the Llano
Estacado back and forth, times without number, on foot,
passing through the very heart of the Comanche country,
without any attempt to disguise himself, or conceal his identity
in any way; and yet there was not a mark upon his person
to attest the dangers through which he had passed scathless
and unharmed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<p>His horsemanship was perfect in its way, and no living
Comanche&mdash;the most wonderful riders on the Western Continent&mdash;had
been known to exceed, and very few to equal him.
For the amusement of those gathered at some of the posts
which he had visited, he had ridden his mustang at full speed
and bare back, throwing himself from one side to the other,
and firing from beneath the neck or belly of the animal, picking
up his hat from the earth when galloping, at the same
headlong rate, striking a match upon a stone on the ground
and carrying the blaze lighted in his hand. He had thrown
the lasso, with such skill, as to catch the hoof of the plunging
buffalo, and then by a flirt of the rope, flung the kicking
brute flat upon his side, as the daring rider thundered past,
and slapped his hat in the eyes of the terrified animal. He
could fling the coil with the unerring certainty of a rifle shot,
and would manipulate the rope into as many fantastical convolutions
as a Chinese conjurer.</p>

<p>His prowess with the rifle was equally marked, and the
tales of his achievements with his favorite weapon were so
incredible in many instances, that we would not be believed
were we to repeat them. He carried a long, murderous-looking
weapon, the mountings of which were of solid silver,
and had been presented to him by one of his many friends,
whom he had been the instrument of saving.</p>

<p>At the home of his old mother at Santa Fe&mdash;the only living
relative he had upon earth&mdash;he had rifles, swords, guns
and every manner of weapon, of the most costly and valuable
nature, that had been given him by grateful friends. His
revered parent during his absence was literally overwhelmed
with attentions and kindnesses by virtue of her relationship to
Lightning Jo, the scout and guide who had proved such a
blessing to the settlers of, and travelers through the West.</p>

<p>The hero was about thirty years of age, slim and tall to
attenuation, with high cheek-bones, eyes of midnight blackness
that snapped fire when he was roused, and long hair, as
stiff, wiry and black as the tail of his mustang. His countenance
was swarthy, and with a little &#8220;touching up&#8221; he might
have deceived Swico himself into the belief that he was one
of his own warriors. This was the more easy as Jo spoke
the Comanche tongue with the fluency of a genuine member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of that warlike tribe; but he scorned such suggestions when
made to him, declaring that he was able to take care of himself
anywhere and in any crowd, no matter who were his
friends or who were his enemies, an assertion which no one
cared to dispute in a practical way.</p>

<p>Looking at his profile as he rode along over the prairie at
a sweeping gallop, it would have been seen that his nose was
large, thin and sharp, the chin rather prominent, and the lips
thin. The mouth was rather large, and the upper lip shaded
by a thin, silky mustache of the same jetty hue as his eyes.
The rest of his face was totally devoid of beard, except a little
furze in front of his ears. He had never used the razor,
nor did he expect to do so.</p>

<p>Of course he sat his horse like a centaur, and, as he rode
along, those keen, restless eyes of his wandered and roved
from side to side, almost unconsciously on his part, as he
was ever on the alert for the first appearance of danger.
Such in brief were a few of the noticeable points of the great
scout, Lightning Jo, who was a leader of the party of rescue,
and who is to play such a prominent part in the thrilling
events we are about to narrate.</p>

<p>As he rode beside Gibbons, whose anxiety was of the most
intense character, and who could not avoid giving frequent
expression to it, the scout at length said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Just stop that &#8217;ere fretting of yours, now, Gib; &#8217;cause it
don&#8217;t pay; don&#8217;t you see we&#8217;re all stretching out on that &#8217;ere
forty miles, just as fast as horse-flesh kin stand it? Wal,
that being so, where&#8217;s the use of fuming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, Jo, but how can a person help it when he knows
not whether his friends are dead or alive? There is philosophy
in your advice about whining and complaining, and it
reminds me of one of the members of the party&mdash;a young
lady, whose disposition had something heavenly in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was she?&#8221; asked the scout, in an indifferent way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her name, I believe, was Manning&mdash;Lizzie Manning&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Lightning Jo, almost bounding from
his saddle, &#8220;is <i>she</i> there, in that infarnal place? How in the
name of Heaven did she get there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was one of the party that left St. Louis, and of course
shared our dangers the same as all.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;The sweetest, purtiest, best little piece of calico that has
been heard,&#8221; repeated the scout to himself. &#8220;God save <i>her</i>,
for she&#8217;s worth all the rest. Come, boys,&#8221; he called out to
those behind him, &#8220;ride your hosses as you never rid &#8217;em afore.
I&#8217;d dash through fire, water, smoke, brimstone and blazes, to
save <i>that</i> gal!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span>CHAPTER IV.</span> <span class="smaller">THE PARTY IN DEAD MAN&#8217;S GULCH.</span></h2>

<p>Leaving Lightning Jo and his party riding at a tremendous
rate over the prairie to the rescue of the sorely beleaguered
company in Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch, we must precede him for
awhile to that terrible spot, where one of the most dreadful
tragedies of the many there enacted was going on.</p>

<p>The party, numbering over thirty, two-thirds of whom
were hardened, bronzed hunters, had been driven tumultuously
into the place by the sudden appearance of the notorious
Swico-Cheque and his band, where they had barely time
to throw their men and horses into the roughest attitude of
defense, when they were called upon to fight the screeching
Comanches, in one of the most murderous and desperate
hand-to-hand encounters in which they had ever been engaged.</p>

<p>Our readers have already learned, from the hurried words
of Gibbons, something of the experience of the beleaguered
whites during the two days and nights immediately following
the halt, and preceding his own departure, and it is not our
purpose to weary them and harrow their feelings by a recital
of the horrible incidents of that stubborn fight.</p>

<p>When Jim Gibbons, hugging the neck of his mustang,
dashed at full speed through the lines of the Comanches, he
left behind him ten able-bodied men, or, more properly, ten
who were still able to load, aim and fire their rifles. More
than that number lay scattered around, among the wagons,
on the ground, in every position, killed by the bullets of the
wonderful red riders and riflemen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<p>The wagons, as is the practice at such times, had been run
together into an irregular circle, one being placed in the center
(as the safest spot), into which the women and children
were tumbled, and where, for the time, they were safe from
the bullets that were rattling like sleet around them, and
striking down their brave defenders upon every hand.</p>

<p>This done, the men devoted themselves to keeping back
the swarming devils, that made a perfect realization of pandemonium
as they circled about the doomed band.</p>

<p>In what way Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch gained its name no one
can tell with any certainty, but most probably from the number
of massacres and deaths that had taken place within its
horrid precincts. It was simply a hollow, somewhat resembling
the dried-up bed of a small lake, and, instead of being
properly a gulch, was more like a basin, so that to enter it
from any direction, one was compelled to descend quite a
slope.</p>

<p>The trail which the party were following led directly
through the center of this place, it being by far the most
feasible route, in spite of the ascent and descent, on account of
the broken nature of the country both to the north and south.</p>

<p>Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch, occupying an area of several acres, was
strewn and covered with bones, as if indeed it were the site
of some ancient catacomb, that had been rent in twain by
some convulsion of nature.</p>

<p>A slight examination would have shown that these bones
were those of horses and human beings, telling in most eloquent
language to the beleaguered whites that the fate which
threatened them was that which had overtaken many a one
before them.</p>

<p>Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch indeed was a favorite point of the Comanches,
who were always roving the prairies in search of
such bands as these, and it was consequently well known
and dreaded by all who were compelled to make the journey;
and the scene to which we now direct the attention of the
reader was, as we have shown, a repetition of what had been
enacted there time and again without number.</p>

<p>The first day&#8217;s fight was especially destructive upon the
horses, it being found almost impossible to shelter them from
the aim of the Comanches. As a consequence, the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
morning found but few of these indispensable requisites in
a journey of this kind. Those that had escaped, however,
were secured and sheltered in such a way as to keep them
from the other bullets that endeavored to seek them out.</p>

<p>Captain Shields, a sturdy borderer, and a man who had
crossed the plains a score of times, suspected from the first
that the only possible hope for his company was for some one
to get through the Comanche lines to Fort Adams, and that
was the reason why he so carefully protected the two or three
remaining mustangs from death.</p>

<p>This, as a matter of course, was the last desperate resort,
and was only to be attempted when it was absolutely certain
that nothing else could avail.</p>

<p>His first hope was that by a determined and deadly resistance
he could convince the red-skins that it would not pay
to keep up the contest, for the warlike Comanches have the
reputation of possessing discretion as well as bravery; but,
in the present case, they certainly were warranted in concluding
they had the game in their own hands, and, despite the
murderous replies of the whites, they refused to be driven
away, and kept up a dropping fire, circling round and round
the hills above, and preventing any attempts of the whites to
move out.</p>

<p>For some time Captain Shields and his men fired from behind
their horses and wagons, but they soon improved on
this, and taking their positions in the wagons themselves,
found that they were quite well able to pick off their assailants,
while they were tolerably well protected from the return
fire, the red-skins being compelled to fire more at random.</p>

<p>And lying in this posture, they were compelled to see the
remaining horses shot down, excepting the single one upon
which Jim Gibbons made his escape.</p>

<p>And thus the fight&mdash;of itself one of the most bitter and
sanguinary among the thousand and one of the West&mdash;raged,
and as it raged there were exhibited some of the most daring
performances upon both sides, and among them all was no
loftier nor higher-souled courage than that of our heroine&mdash;the
young and beautiful Lizzie Manning of Santa Fe.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<h2><span>CHAPTER V.</span> <span class="smaller">THE PARTY OF RESCUE.</span></h2>

<p>The sun was past the meridian, when the hundred men,
under the command of Lightning Jo, left Fort Adams and
struck off in almost a due southerly direction.</p>

<p>It required sharp riding to reach Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch by
nightfall; but all had strong hopes of doing so, as it was
summertime, and a goodly number of hours yet remained at
their command, while their mustangs were toughened and
fleet, and they were now put to the full test of their endurance.</p>

<p>Lightning Jo knew very well the location of the fatal
gulch, and although he did not say as much, yet he had very
little hope of reaching it in time to be of any earthly use to
the poor wretches cramped up there and fighting so desperately
for life.</p>

<p>Swico could not fail to know the meaning of the flight of
Gibbons through his lines. He must know that he was
making all haste to Fort Adams for succor, and that, if he
did not speedily complete the awful business he had taken in
hand, without much longer delay, the chances were that he
would be disputed and compelled to fight a third party.</p>

<p>The prairie continued quite level, with dry grass that did
not prevent a cloud of dust arising from the hoofs of the
horses. The plain was broken here and there by ridges and
hills, some of the latter of considerable elevation. Between
these the rescuing parties were compelled frequently to pass,
some of them being so close together that the thought of an
ambuscade was instantly suggested to the mind of every
one.</p>

<p>But Jo was not the man to go it blind into any contrivance
that the red-skins might set to entrap him, and his practiced
eye made certain that all was right before he exposed his
brave men to such danger.</p>

<p>He was rather expecting some flank movement upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
part of his old enemy, but he was disposed to believe that,
whatever plan he adopted, he would not &#8220;try it on&#8221; until
the whites reached the vicinity of Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe he&#8217;s got things fixed to tumble us in there too,&#8221;
he thought to himself; &#8220;and mebbe ef he has, he&#8217;ll find his
flint will miss fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company galloped steadily forward until something
like three-fourths of the distance was passed, and the sun was
low in the west. They were riding along at the same rattling
pace, all on the alert for signs of their enemies, and
they were just &#8220;rising&#8221; a swell of moderate elevation, flanked
on both sides by still higher hills, when the peremptory voice
of Lightning Jo was heard, ordering a halt.</p>

<p>The command was obeyed with extraordinary precision,
and every man knew as if by instinct that trouble was at
hand. Naturally enough their eyes were turned toward the
hills, as if expecting to see a band of Comanches swarming
down upon them, and in imagination they heard the bloodcurdling
yells, as they poured tumultuously over the elevations,
exulting in the work of death at their hands.</p>

<p>But all was still, nor could they detect any thing to warrant
fear, although the manner of Lightning Jo indicated
clearly that such was the case.</p>

<p>He did not keep them long in suspense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the Comanches are there,&#8221; remarked Lightning
Jo, in his offhand manner; &#8220;whether old Swico himself is
among &#8217;em or not, I can&#8217;t say till I go forward and find out.
Keep your guns and pistols ready, for there may be a thousand
of &#8217;em down on ye afore ye know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this parting salutation, or rather warning, the
scout started his horse on a gallop, straight toward the rise,
as though he purposed to ride directly between the hills already
mentioned. But seemingly on the very point of entering,
he turned his mustang sharply to one side, and instead
of passing between, circled around the hill upon his right.</p>

<p>All this time he sat as erect and proud in his saddle as
though he were approaching the stockade of the fort, which
he had made his head-quarters for so many years.</p>

<p>The cavalrymen, as a matter of course, scrutinized his
movements with the intensest interest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;How easy for a stray shot to tumble him out of his saddle!&#8221;
was the reflection of nearly every one watching the
daring soldier.</p>

<p>This action of Lightning Jo speedily carried him over a
portion of the ridge, and out of sight of the horsemen, who
could only surmise what was going on beyond.</p>

<p>But the sharp, pistol-like crack of a rifle, within five minutes
of the time he had vanished from view, proved that the
fears of Lightning Joe were well founded, and that the drama
had already opened in dead earnest.</p>

<p>Indeed it had. The scout had detected all-convincing
signs of the presence of his old enemies upon the hill, and
the simple artifice of turning aside, at the last moment, had
given him the advantage of flanking his foes, and coming
upon them from altogether an unexpected quarter.</p>

<p>As he passed over the ridge, Jo saw about twenty Comanche
Indians sitting quietly upon their horses, and in a
position that indicated that they were composedly expecting
the appearance of their prey from another quarter. Instead
of turning to flee, the scout saluted them in his customary
manner by bringing up his rifle, and boring a hole through
the skull of one of the astonished red-skins, before the rest
really suspected what was going on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tahoo&mdash;oo!&#8221; called out Jo, as he witnessed the success
of his shot, and he followed it up with another yell that was
peculiarly his own, and which was so impossible of imitation
that he was known by it from Arizona to Mexico.</p>

<p>The Comanches were not men of wood to sit still upon
their animals, and remain targets for one of the most skillful
riflemen living.</p>

<p>Identifying their assailant by means of his yell, they instantly
scattered, as if a bombshell had landed among them,
and they scampered down the other side of an adjoining
hill, and out of sight of Jo, carrying their fallen comrade
with them.</p>

<p>This, it would seem, ought to have satisfied the scout, but
it did not. He suspected that a larger party of Indians was
in the neighborhood, and determined to make sure before returning
to his men.</p>

<p>The actions of the Comanches seemed to indicate that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
were about making an attempt to surround him, and he made
ready to guard against it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em surround me! I feel wolfish to-day, and I think
it&#8217;ll do me good to let off some of my extra steam among &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gazed furtively over his shoulder, nevertheless, for he
had no wish to be taken off his guard, in such a desperate
encounter as this was certain to prove, in case a collision occurred.</p>

<p>His mustang stepped very carefully, with his head raised
and his ears pricked, for he fully felt the delicacy of the situation,
and knew that at any moment they were liable to be
enveloped by a horde of their enemies.</p>

<p>The sagacity of the horse was the first to give notice of
the approach of danger. He was stepping stealthily along,
his senses on the alert, when he suddenly paused, with a
slight whinny.</p>

<p>At the same instant, Lightning Jo caught a peculiar sound,
as if made by the grating of a horse&#8217;s hoof upon the gravel,
and he turned his head with the quickness of lightning.</p>

<p>There they were, sure enough!</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER VI.</span> <span class="smaller">LIGHTNING JO IN A SCRIMMAGE.</span></h2>

<p>Yes; Lightning Jo found that the Comanches were coming,
and at a rather rapid rate, too. There was no flinging
himself over the side of his mustang and making him a
shield against the blows of the red-skins, for the latter were
on every side of him. The fact was they had recognized
that peculiar yell of his, and hastily laid their plans to make
him prisoner.</p>

<p>But Jo wasn&#8217;t made a prisoner yet, by a long shot, and
finding that he was at a disadvantage on the back of his
steed, he quietly slipped off; looping his rifle by a contrivance
of his own to his side, he whipped out a couple of revolvers,
one in either hand, and the fun began on the instant.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t the way of Jo to await the opening of a game
like this, but to open it himself, and the instant he could
cock the handy little weapons, he began popping away right
and left, the astounded Comanches going down like ten-pins
before the savage &#8220;bull-dogs,&#8221; who had a way of biting every
time they gave utterance to a bark. But there were but ten
such &#8220;bites&#8221; available, and carefully as the scout husbanded
his ammunition, the barrels were speedily emptied without
any sensible diminution of his peril.</p>

<p>There was no one Comanche, nor no single half-dozen of
them, that would have believed it possible to secure possession
of Lightning Jo, and so they went into the scrimmage
in such overwhelming numbers that escape upon his part
looked impossible. By the time the barrels of his revolvers
were emptied there were fully fifty Indians surrounding him.
Nearly, if not quite all of them, were mounted, and they
were not the men to show mercy to such a character as
Lightning Jo, who had worked more mischief against the
tribe than any dozen frontiersmen with whom they had exchanged
shots.</p>

<p>Had this indomitable scout been alone upon the prairie
his lighting would undoubtedly have been of the most terrific
nature, and he would have died, like Colonel Crockett at the
Alamo, with an &#8220;army of dead&#8221; about him; but with all of
Jo&#8217;s wonderful prowess, he saw that the assistance of his
friends was needed, and without any hesitation he gave utterance
to his &#8220;call,&#8221; which reached the ears of his listening
cavalrymen, who were equally prompt in responding to the
cry.</p>

<p>But the time that must elapse between the call and the
arrival of reinforcements, short as it was, was all sufficient
for the Comanches to encompass the death of a dozen antagonists,
unless they were checked by a most stubborn and skillful
resistance.</p>

<p>And just that resistance and that fight now took place.</p>

<p>Instead of clubbing his rifle and using the weapon in that
shape, as almost any man would have done, Jo now had recourse
to that wonderful science in which he was such an
adept, demonstrating that to such a man there is no weapon
at his command like the naked fist.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>It was a treat to see him use his powers, and had he only
possessed a rock or wall to back against, so as to prevent an
insidious approach from behind, he could have kept off the
Comanche nation, so long as they lunged up to him in such
a blind, headlong fashion as the present.</p>

<p>The posture taken by Lightning Jo was according to the
latest &#8220;rules of the London prize ring,&#8221; and consisted in having
his arms up in front of him, the left slightly in advance,
while he balanced himself upon his left foot, so poised that
he was &#8220;firm on his pins,&#8221; or ready to leap backward or forward,
as necessity demanded.</p>

<p>The foremost Comanche, who had dismounted, was almost
up to Jo, when he thought somebody&#8217;s mustang had kicked
him fairly in the face, and he made three back summersets
before he could put the brake on. And then, just as he was
getting up, he was knocked down again by a couple of his comrades
going over him, and then, as those arms began working
like piston-rods, and with a velocity a hundred times as great,
the cracking of heads was something like the going off of a
pack of Chinese crackers ignited together.</p>

<p>Heads were down and heels up, as the red-skins leaped
from the backs of their animals and charged in upon the
scout, who, as cool as when partaking of a leisurely meal,
allowed every one to come just within reach of his iron knuckles,
when he let drive like a cannon shot.</p>

<p>Finding that it was impossible to take him afoot, several
of the red-skins attempted to ride him down; but there was
something in his appearance as he thus acted on the defensive
that prevented them from approaching too close, just as the
bravest horse will recoil from the bear when he faces about.</p>

<p>Then, too, as it became apparent that there was no capturing
the scout in front, the Indians exerted themselves to the
utmost to steal around in his rear, and to fling him to the
ground. This kept things lively for the time, and the way
Lightning Jo spun around and danced upon his legs, striking
incessantly, and occasionally putting in a terrific kick now and
then, was a marvel in itself.</p>

<p>Now he seemed to be down and out of sight, but the next
instant he popped up from some other point, and sent in a
volley of blows with the same lightning-like force and skill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
The Indian that clutched at him and was certain he had got
him, clutched the empty air, and did get, along the head, in
such a way that he ever after held him in the most vivid remembrance.</p>

<p>All this was thrilling and, in a certain sense, amusing; but
after all, despite the extraordinary skill and quickness displayed
by the scout, it could not really extricate him from the difficulty.
A man has but two arms with which to guard himself,
and when he is pressed from every point, with an increasing
pressure, no human being can keep such a swarm at a
distance. He is like the man set upon by thousands of rats.</p>

<p>Furthermore, although Jo knew that his friends were making
all haste to his rescue, yet he saw things could not remain
as they were even until then.</p>

<p>He therefore determined to make a desperate attempt to
break through the surrounding lines.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER VII.</span> <span class="smaller">THE ANGEL OF THE PRAIRIE.</span></h2>

<p>In the awful sufferings to which communities and companies
are sometimes doomed, it is often found that the most
delicate and refined females display the greatest fortitude and
the truest heroism. When the terrible calamity came upon
Captain Shields and his party, it was generally supposed that
the first to succumb, from sheer terror alone, would be the
frail, blue-eyed, laughing Lizzie Manning, whose gentleness
of heart, and mirthful ways, had won the affections of all,
before the journey from St. Louis was fairly begun.</p>

<p>There was a blanching of the damask cheek, a faint scream
of fear, when the half naked Comanches suddenly burst forth
to view, and sent in their first volley, and she scrambled
nimbly into the &#8220;fort,&#8221; as the refuge wagon was termed,
thoughtful enough, however, to be the very last one to enter.
By the time she had taken her place upon the straw-covered
floor upon the bottom, her courage had returned to her, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
more properly speaking, she rose to the situation, and displayed
a lofty courage and a rare good sense that excited the
wonder and compelled the admiration of all.</p>

<p>By her aid, the screaming, terrified children were speedily
quieted, and the scarcely less frantic mothers were made to
realize that their own safety lay in retaining their self possession,
and keeping themselves and their children out of range
of the rifle-balls that were clipping the canvas covering of
the wagon, and burying themselves in the planking all about
them. By this means something like order was obtained in
the crowded little party, and they had nothing to do but to
watch furtively the fighting going on all around them, to
look at the horrid Comanches circling back and forth, with
wonderful contortions upon their horses, to see their frightful
grimaces, and the flash of their rifles almost in their very
faces, as they seemed to be rushing down as if about to overwhelm
and crush the little party out of existence.</p>

<p>It was a thrilling sight that they looked upon, as they saw
these Indians pitching headlong from their saddles; but their
hearts were wrung with anguish as they saw more than one
of their own number fall, some at full length beneath the
wagons, and others among the floundering horses, where their
deaths were frequently hastened by the hoofs of the frantic
animals.</p>

<p>Suddenly Lizzie Manning sprung from the wagon, and
heedless of the hurtling bullets, started to run across the open
space inclosed by the irregular circle of wagons. She had
taken but a few steps, when a young man dashed out from
the rear of one of the lumbering wagons, and excitedly waved
her back.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, Lizzie, back this instant!&#8221; he called
out, walking rapidly toward her in his anxiety; &#8220;it is sure
death to advance. Wait not a second!&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused, as if the voice had a familiar sound, and
stared in a bewildered way at the speaker, a fine, manly-looking
young fellow, whose hair was blown about his face,
and whose pale countenance and flashing eyes showed that
he appreciated the danger, and had the courage not to flinch
before it.</p>

<p>Only for a moment did the young maiden pause, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
(only a few feet separating them, as he had continued advancing
from the first) she pointed to the prostrate figure of a man
beneath the wagons.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is Harrison, who has been so kind to me, ever
since we started&mdash;he fell just now, and stretched out his arms
for help. I must go to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is past all help,&#8221; said the man, solemnly, &#8220;and you
will only lose your own life if you venture near him, for he
took one of the most dangerous posts of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, he may be alive, and I may be of help to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as she spoke, the maiden hurried on to where the
prostrate and now silent figure of one of her defenders lay.
The distance was short, but as Egbert Rodman had declared,
it was encompassed with death; and for one moment he meditated
seizing the arm of the girl, and compelling her by main
force to return to the shelter of the wagon; but something
in her manner and appearance restrained him; and, forgetful
of his own peril, he gazed with an awed feeling, as he would
have watched the tread of an angel upon this sinful earth of
ours.</p>

<p>With a somewhat rapid tread, but without any undue
haste, and certainly without any fear, Lizzie advanced straight
to the wagon where the poor fellow lay, flat upon his back,
and directly between the wheels, motionless and with one
knee drawn up, as if asleep.</p>

<p>Kneeling down she took the hand still warm in her own,
and with the other brushed back the dank hair from the forehead
of the man, and asked, in that wonderfully sweet voice
of hers:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Harrison, is there nothing I can do for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened his eyes, and looked at her with a dim wildness,
his face ashy pale, and then something like a smile lit
up his ghastly features, as he pointed to his breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife&mdash;my babe&mdash;darling Nelly&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She understood him, and drew from his breast-pocket a
photograph of his wife&mdash;with a rosy-cheeked, smiling cherub
of a little girl, laughing beside her knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell them&mdash;my last thoughts&mdash;my last prayers were of
them&mdash;&#8221; he stammered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will&mdash;I will,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;Is there nothing more I
can do&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>He made an effort to speak, but the words were choked in
their utterance, and with his eyes fixed upon hers, he died
without a struggle.</p>

<p>But that one soulful, grateful look of those dark eyes, as
they faded out in death, amply repaid the brave-hearted Lizzie
Manning for the noble deed she had done, and she rose
to her feet, glad that she had heeded the mute call of the dying
man, who could have scarcely hoped, at such a time and
under such circumstances, any heed would have been paid to
it, unless it were the mocking taunts of the merciless Comanches.</p>

<h2><span>CHAPTER VIII.</span> <span class="smaller">A DARING DEED.</span></h2>

<p>In the mean time, the battle was raging with infernal hotness.
All of Captain Shields&#8217; party were unerring marksmen,
and they were so accustomed to the most desperate contests
with the red-skins, that despite the terrible strait in which
they were placed, they preserved their coolness and equipoise
like true veterans, and loaded and fired with such rapid sureness,
that to this alone may be attributed the severe check,
which kept the Comanches from making an overwhelming
charge, that would have carried every thing before them.</p>

<p>The first night passed with little disturbance, as we have
already shown, and the second day the battle was renewed
and kept up with scarcely an intermission until nightfall.</p>

<p>This day, especially the latter portion, was very warm, and
the suffering of the little band was terrible&mdash;so much so that
many of the living envied the dead, who had been so speedily
released from their distress. The thirst felt by all was a
perpetual torment, from which there was scarcely the slightest
relief. Many of the men, despite the great danger, dug
into the ground, until the damp soil was reached, which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
scooped up and placed in their mouths as a slight assuagement
of their anguish.</p>

<p>The females stood the trial like martyrs, for their own
greatest suffering was that of seeing the half-dozen moaning
children piteously begging for water, when there was none
to give them.</p>

<p>The history of the world has proven that men will run any
risk, no matter what, for the sake of satisfying the maddening
thirst, that threatens to drive them raving wild; and, it
was this that was the cause of one of the most daring deeds
ever recorded, upon the part of young Egbert Rodman.</p>

<p>The Comanches could not but be aware of this fearful distress
of the whites, and with a fiendish malignity, characteristic
of the Indian race, just at nightfall, when the Dead
Man&#8217;s Gulch was bathed in mellow twilight, one of the red-skins
was seen to leap off his mustang and walk toward the
encampment, with a large tin canteen in his hand&mdash;a relic
undoubtedly of some massacre of United States soldiers.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the firing at this moment, and the
whites, at a loss to understand the meaning of the proceeding,
stealthily peered out from their coverts in the wagons, to
learn what new trick was on the <i>tapis</i>.</p>

<p>It looked as if he were going to summon them to surrender,
or call for a parley, as he walked straight forward
until he was within a hundred feet of the nearest wagon,
when he paused and held up the canteen before him, contorting
his face into the most grotesque grimaces, and shaking
the vessel in front and over his head.</p>

<p>The stillness at this moment was so profound, that more
than one distinctly heard the gurgle of water in the vessel,
and, if any doubt remained of the red-skin&#8217;s purpose, it was
dissipated by his calling out, in broken English:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yengese&mdash;come&mdash;muchee drink&mdash;hab muchee drink&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>These words were scarcely uttered, when <i>crack, crack</i> went
two rifles almost simultaneously, and the foolhardy wretch
made a scrambling leap, and his taunting words ended in a
wild howl, as he fell prostrate across the can, that he had
brandished so tormentingly in the faces of the sufferers.</p>

<p>It is strange that such a dog should not have known the
risk he ran in making such a taunt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>The Indian had scarcely fallen when several of his comrades
started down the declivity to bring away his body. At
the same moment, Egbert Rodman, who was in one of the
wagons, sprung out, and was seen to run at full speed in the
direction of the fallen man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back! come back! or you&#8217;re a dead man!&#8221; shouted
Captain Shields, divining his purpose on the instant.</p>

<p>But the young man&#8217;s lips were set, and he was determined
upon possessing that canteen, if it were within the range of
human possibility. He saw a horde of Comanches swarming
down the gulch on a full run, screeching like demons, and
evidently certain of securing the daring Yengee, whose torturing
thirst had stolen away his senses.</p>

<p>But Egbert was not to be deterred by any such appalling
danger as this. Now that he had undertaken the desperate
task, nothing but death should turn him aside!</p>

<p>In far less time than it requires to be narrated, he had sped
over the intervening ground, and was at the prostrate figure.
He was fleet of foot, and he ran as he never ran before, reaching
it, however, only a few seconds in advance of the rescuing
Comanches, one of whom actually fired and missed him,
when scarcely a rod in advance.</p>

<p>One tremendous jerk of his arm, and Egbert threw the
dead Indian off the canteen, and catching it up in his hand, he
turned about and started at the same headlong speed for the
encampment, clinging to the vessel as if it was his own life;
but the Comanches were all about him, and it looked as if it
was all up, when he whipped out his only weapon&mdash;his revolver,
and blazed away right and left in their very faces.
At the same instant the whites opened fire, and made such
havoc, that in the confusion Egbert made a dash, and sped
like a reindeer for the wagons, and leaped in behind them
with the canteen and the water and himself intact.</p>

<p>Then a shout went up from within the little band, and
making his way to the central wagon, Egbert first furnished
the moaning children with several swallows of the delicious&mdash;(oh,
how delicious!) fluid, no argument inducing Lizzie
Manning to take a drop, until all her companions had first
done so.</p>

<p>Then the brave fellow made his way from man to man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
every one partaking of the soul-reviving cold water, whose
delicious taste could not have been approached by the &#8220;nectar
of the gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>All drank moderately, for they knew that Egbert was to
come last, and nothing could induce one to cut his allowance
short; and so he let several swallows gurgle down his parched
throat, when he carried the remainder to the women&#8217;s wagon,
and placing it in the hands of Lizzie, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it for the poor suffering little ones and for yourselves!
We are hardy men, and can stand thirst better than
they, and know how to chew our bullets, when we have nothing
else!&#8221;</p>

<p>With many a fervent blessing upon the noble fellow&#8217;s head,
the canteen was accepted and preserved as he requested.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER IX.</span> <span class="smaller">THE LOVERS.</span></h2>

<p>The second night the moon, that rode high on the sky,
enabled the little party of white men in Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch
to detect the Comanches as they prowled about, and our
friends proved their vigilance by picking off every one who
thus exposed himself to their deadly rifles.</p>

<p>For the first half of the night little rest was obtained by
either side&mdash;the spitting shots continuing with a rapidity, and
in such numbers, as sometimes to resemble platoon firing&mdash;but,
shortly past the turn of night, the Comanches seemed to
grow weary of the incessant din, and being a fair target for
the whites so long as they remained on the hill, where they
were brought in fair relief against the sky, they assumed
safer positions, and for a long time perfect silence remained.</p>

<p>By this time, despite the respite afforded by the captured
canteen, the condition of the party was as desperate as it
could be. Although the whites had been very careful in exposing
themselves to the aim of the Comanches, yet so deadly
had it been that there were now only ten men left, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>including
Gibbons. Shortly after midnight two of these made the
attempt to steal through the environing lines, and both lost
their lives, in the manner recorded elsewhere. This left but
eight able-bodied men to continue the defense, and Gibbons
began arranging his flight with Shields, they keeping it a
secret from the rest, as it was feared that there would be a
strife as to who should go, every one being anxious to get out
of such a hell as Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch by any means, so long as
a suitable pretext could be found.</p>

<p>But one horse was left unharmed. The others were dead,
stretched in different places around the open space, and, under
the warm sun, an odor of the most offensive character
was beginning to rise from them. Worse still, there were
men here and there, and some of them in wagons, to whom
the right of sepulture could not be given; and they lay, with
dark, discolored faces, staring up to the sky, happier than
were those who were left behind to struggle and fight on,
only to die at last a still more dreadful death then had come
to them.</p>

<p>All was still, and in the large wagons, devoted to the shelter
of the women and children, the latter were sound asleep,
as were most of the former. Lizzie Manning had endeavored
to inspire hope in the despairing ones around her, and was
now sitting, with folded hands, upon a blanket, her shawl
gathered over her shoulders, and in that attitude was awaiting
sleep, when she heard a faint footstep near her, and turning
her head, descried the figure of Egbert Rodman advancing,
with a hesitating step, in that direction, his actions
indicating that he felt considerable doubt as to the propriety
of that which he was doing.</p>

<p>Believing that he was seeking an opportunity to say something
to her, Lizzie spoke to him in a low, reassuring voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Egbert, is it I that you wish to see? If so, come
nearer, where your voice will not be so likely to be heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wondering whether you were asleep or not,&#8221; he replied,
making his way to the rear of the wagon, where her
face could be seen looking encouragingly out upon him.
&#8220;There is no fighting going on at present; it won&#8217;t do for
one to go to sleep, and I was thinking that possibly you
might be awake, and with no ability to close your eyes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
slumber. But, if you have, don&#8217;t fail to say so, and I will
wait until to-morrow, or until there is a more favorable opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not leave, Egbert,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I did not sleep
a single minute last night, nor can I do so to-night. I am
glad that you have come, that we may have a chat with each
other, without disturbing any one else. Somehow or other,
I feel a strong conviction that this is the last night that will
be spent in the gulch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Egbert had thought the same for hours, but he had kept
his premonitions to himself, and it cut him to the heart when
the gentle and ordinarily light-hearted girl spoke of it in such
positive and hopeless tones.</p>

<p>Yet nothing was to be gained by denying the existence of
such a desperate strait.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does look so, indeed,&#8221; he replied, in a low voice, as he
leaned against the wagon in such a posture that his head was
brought close to hers. &#8220;It is not likely that any diversion
will be created in our favor, and we can not keep up a successful
resistance much longer. <i>Our numbers are getting too
small.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope they will end this struggle by firing into and killing
us all together,&#8221; returned Lizzie, in her sad, sweet tones,
and her heart gave a great throb as she reflected upon the
fate of falling into the hands of these tiger-like Comanches.
&#8220;Do you not think they will do so, Egbert?&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not answer in the affirmative, so he did the best
thing possible, making answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that we shall keep up the fighting as long as
any of us are left. When our men become so scarce, or are
nearly all gone, the women can take their places, and thus
compel the death which I know would be welcome to all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Egbert,&#8221; said she, in tones of Christian resignation,
&#8220;it is only a step between this and the other life. Father
and mother and sisters and brothers will mourn when they
learn of the death that Lizzie died, but then she has only
gone on before&mdash;just ahead of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the young lover, who felt soothed, albeit
saddened, by the words of the sweet girl. Reaching up his
hand, he took hers, and with a solemn, sacred feeling, said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose, Lizzie, now that we stand in the presence of
death, you will permit me to declare how I loved you the
first time I saw you in St. Louis, and how that love has increased
and deepened with every hour since, until I feel now,
like the romantic cavaliers of old, that it is sweet to stand
here, and to die, knowing that I die defending your honor
and your life. Lizzie, my own dearest one, you have all my
heart. None who have seen you can fail to respect your
sweetness of character, and the veriest slave was never held
a more helpless captive by his task-master than I am by you.
It would be idle for me to expect any thing like a similar
emotion upon your part, but I am sure you will not be offended
at what I have said. Tell me that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I am not&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Egbert fell her hand tremble in his own, and a strange
yearning came over him to hear what she had checked herself
in saying. Could it be that she felt in any degree the
same emotion that penetrated his whole being? No, impossible;
and yet what meant this trembling, this agitation, this
excitement?</p>

<p>But she said not the words he was so anxious to hear, and
they talked awhile longer upon the desperate situation, and
then, kissing the dear hand that he had fondled and held imprisoned
in his own, he bade her good-night, and returned to
his post of duty.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER X.</span> <span class="smaller">AT FULL SPEED.</span></h2>

<p>All through this singular fight, Lightning Jo had kept
within reach of his mustang, which occasionally put in a kick
now and then, in the hope that he might be turned to account;
but the tumult and uproar became so terrific, that he
finally became panic-stricken, and with a whinny of the wildest
terror, he made a plunge among the scarcely-less excited
animals, when his furious struggles added to the fearful <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>uproar,
which was already sufficient to drive an ordinary man
out of his senses.</p>

<p>Lightning Jo, as we have said, knew that his friends were
coming over the hills at the topmost bent of their speed; but
the flight of his horse, and the rapid closing in of the Comanches,
made further delay fatal, and with the promptness that
was a peculiar characteristic of the man, he grasped his loaded
rifle in his hands, and made his desperate struggle for freedom.</p>

<p>This was simply an attempt to dodge beneath the horses&#8217;
bellies out beyond them, where he knew his own fleetness
could be depended on to carry him safely into the company
of his own men.</p>

<p>And now began a most extraordinary performance, and an
exhibition of Lightning Jo&#8217;s miraculous quickness of movement
was given, such as would seem incredible in a description
like ours. He was walled in on every hand by the
swarming Comanches, but by the matchless use of his tremendous
arms, he kept back the scores from entangling him
in their embrace; until, all at once, he was seen to make a
leap upward, directly over the shoulders of those immediately
surrounding, and he shot beneath the belly of the nearest
mustang like a whizzing rocket.</p>

<p>And, as he did so, he gave utterance to that strange yell
of his, like the yelping prairie-dog, whose bark is cut short,
as he plunges headlong into his hole, by the sudden whisking
of his head out of sight.</p>

<p>The Comanches who caught the dissolving view of the
scout, made a desperate struggle to capture him, and those
who were still mounted, and saw him leaping beneath their
animals, turned them aside, and cut, slashed and thrust at
him in the most spiteful fashion, while others sprung off their
horses, and did their utmost to intercept and cut him off, or
to trip him to the earth, or to disable him in some way that
would prevent his succeeding in his threatened escape from
their clutches.</p>

<p>It would be a vain attempt to follow his movements in the
way of description, when the eye itself was unable to do so;
and, despite the astonishing celerity of the Comanches, whose
nimbleness of movement is proverbial in the West, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
were completely baffled in every effort they made to entrap
him.</p>

<p>Here, there, everywhere, he was seen, shooting out sometimes
from between a horse&#8217;s legs, and then was in another
place before the animal could resent the shock given him&mdash;in
front&mdash;in the rear&mdash;leaping to one side&mdash;backward&mdash;forward&mdash;and
threw the whole troop into confusion&mdash;every now and
then giving utterance to that indescribable yell, so that the
red-skins were actually in chase of <i>that</i>&mdash;and all the time
steadily approaching the outer circle of mustangs, and ever
keeping in mind the proper direction for him to follow, to
meet the much-needed soldiers.</p>

<p>And all this took place in one-tenth the time required in
our references. The bewildering dodging and doubling of
Lightning Jo continued until he shot from beneath the last
horse, and then with a triumphant screech, he sped away like
a terrified antelope.</p>

<p>Hitherto the efforts of the Comanches had been directed
toward capturing the redoubtable scout, and they soon dashed
their animals after him on a full run, in the hope of riding
him down before he could reach the assistance which they
knew was so close at hand.</p>

<p>It proved closer indeed than they suspected; for they had
hardly started upon the fierce pursuit when a rattling discharge
of rifles rose above the din and confusion, just as the
whole company of United States cavalry thundered over the
ridge, and came down upon them like the sweep of a tornado
that carries every thing before it.</p>

<p>There were a few exchanges of shots, and then the Comanches
would have excited the admiration of a troop of
Centaurs by their display of horsemanship. Speeding forward
like a whirlwind, the shock of the opposing bodies
seemed certain to be like that of an earthquake; but, at the
very instant of striking, every Indian shied off, either to the
right or the left, and by a quick, rapid circle of their well
trained animals, they shot away beyond reach of harm from
cavalry, and skurried away over the hills and ridges, disappearing
from view with the same astonishing quickness,
that made successful pursuit out of the question.</p>

<p>Driven away in this unceremonious fashion, the Comanches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
were compelled to leave their dead upon the field&mdash;the
wounded managing to take care of themselves, and to get out
of harm&#8217;s way, ere the cavalry could swoop down upon them.
The fashion of giving quarter, in the contests between
the Indians and white men, has never been very popular, and
at the present day, it may be considered practically obsolete,
so that the Comanches displayed only ordinary discretion in
&#8220;getting up and getting&#8221;&mdash;if we may be permitted to use
the expressive language of the West itself, in referring to an
engagement of this kind.</p>

<p>Accustomed as were these men to the exhibitions of the
wonderful powers of Lightning Jo, they were astounded at
the exhibition of their own eyes, of the deeds he had done
during the few minutes that he had engaged in the encounter
with the red-skins. The troop gathered around the battlefield,
and were commenting in their characteristic manner
upon his exploits, when the scout himself, seeing his mustang
near at hand, made haste to secure him, and leaping upon his
back, he lost no time in placing himself at their lead, and
turning his face toward Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch, he said, in his
sharp, peremptory way, when thoroughly in earnest:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, boys, we have lost too much time. We must git
there afore dark, if we git there at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gibbons, the messenger, placed himself beside him, and, as
soon as they were fairly under way, Jo remarked to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know what to make of it. Old Swico is not
with them skunks, and I am disappointed. It has a bad
look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221; inquired his comrade, who was partly prepared
for the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t sartin&mdash;but it looks to me as if the <i>business is finished
down at the Gulch</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why should not the chief, released from there, be
here with his men?&#8221; continued Gibbons.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is only a part of his men; there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t many Comanches
among the hills. I think the old dog sent them off
on purpose to bother us and keep us back as much as they
could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While Swico and the others have taken another direction?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly, and carried the women and children with them;
and if so, we might as well turn back to Fort Adams
ag&#8217;in.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the scout, as he uttered these chilling words, set his
teeth, and rode his mustang harder than ever toward Dead
Man&#8217;s Gulch.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER XI.</span> <span class="smaller">THE VALLEY OF DEATH.</span></h2>

<p>The wagon containing the females and the children was
that which carried the provisions&mdash;the others being piled up
with the luggage belonging to the different members of the
party, and which they had formed into rude barricades from
which they fired out, with such deadly effect, upon the Comanches,
who, from the nature of the case, were unable to
make any kind of approach without exposing themselves to
that same unerring fire.</p>

<p>One of the men, at stated periods, visited the provision
wagon, and brought forth lunch for his comrades, who felt
no suffering in <i>that</i> respect&mdash;their great trial being the lack
of water. But for the providential supply, secured in the
manner already narrated, human endurance would not have
permitted the whites to have held out longer than the beginning
of this terrible, and what was destined to prove the last,
day&mdash;the one following the departure of Gibbons, the messenger,
for Fort Adams.</p>

<p>It should be made clear at this point also that, of the half-dozen
women, and the same number of children, not one had
husband, or father, or blood-relative among the defenders, so
that, while their situation could scarcely have been more trying,
it was deprived of the poignant anguish of seeing the
members of their own household shot down in cold blood
before their eyes.</p>

<p>No pen can depict the gratitude and love they felt for
these men, who, it may be said, were giving up their lives to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
protect them; for, at the first appearance of the dreaded
Comanches, every one of them could have secured their safety
by dashing away at full speed, upon their fleet-footed mustangs,
and leaving the helpless ones to their fate.</p>

<p>But of such a fashion is not the Western borderer, who
will go to certain death, rather than prove false to those who
have been intrusted to his care. The party had been sent to
St. Louis, under an agreement to bring this little company to
their homes in Santa Fe, on their return from an excursion
to the Eastern States, and there was not one of them who
would have dared to ride into the beautiful Mexican town
with the tidings that they had perished, and he had lived to
tell the tale. Far better, a thousand times, that their bones
should be left to bleach upon the prairie, rather than they
should live to be forever disgraced and dishonored, and to
carry an accusing conscience with them for the remainder of
their days.</p>

<p>The children, during the first twenty four hours, probably
suffered the most, in their cramped, constrained position, being
compelled to remain within the wagon, lest, if they exposed
themselves by appearing upon the ground, they should
be slain by the Comanches, who availed themselves of every
opportunity to retaliate upon the whites.</p>

<p>After it became pretty certain that Jim Gibbons had penetrated
and passed through the Comanche lines, Captain
Shields prepared for a deadly charge from their enemies, and
from his place in his vehicle he called to the others to make
ready also.</p>

<p>The men thus talked with each other, while their faces
were mutually invisible; but the little circle permitted the
freest intercommunication. His advice was followed, and
every rifle loaded and kept ready to be discharged at an instant&#8217;s
warning.</p>

<p>It was terribly annoying to feel, at a juncture like this,
that they must husband their fire on account of the failing
supply of ammunition, and at the same time manage the business
in such a way that the Comanches themselves should
not be permitted to discover the appalling truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fire too often,&#8221; called the captain, in his cautious
way, &#8220;and when you do make sure that you let daylight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
through one of the red devils. I think they will open on us
in some way, and very soon, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed strange that the uproar and tumult which had
marked the flight of Gibbons should be succeeded in its turn
by such a profound silence as now rested upon the gulch.
From the place where our friends crouched not a single Comanche
could be seen, nor could their location be detected
by the slightest sound.</p>

<p>From far away on the prairie came the faint sound of a
rifle&mdash;but in the immediate vicinity all was still.</p>

<p>Captain Shields was of the opinion that Swico, the chief,
had gathered his warriors around him, just outside the gulch,
and was holding a consultation as to what was the best to be
done, as it was now as good as certain that, before the dawn
of another day, a heavy force of cavalry would be down upon
them.</p>

<p>There were some who really believed that the Comanches
would now draw off and disappear altogether from the place
where they had suffered such a terrible repulse; but for this
very reason, the experienced frontiersman, Captain Shields,
was certain that the contrary would prove to be the case.
The incitement of revenge would prompt them rather to
make the most desperate charges and the most furious assaults
upon the little Spartan band.</p>

<p>And while the old hunter lay upon his face in the wagon,
stealthily peering out, and listening for the first approach of
his foes, he coolly calculated the chances of the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six of us left, and we average three rifles apiece&mdash;to say
nothing of revolvers that are scattered all among the boys.
We can load and fire these, perhaps four or five times apiece&mdash;not
oftener, certainly&mdash;that is, if we can only get the opportunity
to load and fire them. After that&mdash; Well, everybody
has got to die some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, he stealthily moved around, and peered out at the
wagon containing the helpless ones, and he muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;All seems to be quiet there, and I guess none of them
have been reached by these bullets whizzing all about them,
which may be either good or bad fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then as he resumed his position of guard, he cleared his
vision with his hand, and added:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty rough on them. We men are always expecting
such things, and are sort of ready for it; but for helpless
women and children&mdash; Helloa! what in the name of Heaven
can that be?&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER XII.</span> <span class="smaller">&#8220;WHAT IS IT?&#8221;</span></h2>

<p>Captain Shields might well give utterance to this exclamation,
for just then his eyes were greeted with the most
singular sight he had ever seen in all his life. He rubbed his
eyes and stared, and finally turned to young Egbert Rodman,
who just then crawled into the wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I was a drinking man,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I would swear that
I had the jim-jams sure. Look out the wagon, Rodman, and
tell me whether you see any thing unusual, or different from
what we have been accustomed to look upon for the last day
or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man did as requested, and the exclamation that
escaped him convinced the somewhat nervous officer that his
head was still level, and his brain was playing no fantastic
freak with him.</p>

<p>The sight which greeted their eyes, and so excited their
wonder, came first in the shape of a horse, which, walking
slowly forward, steadily loomed up to view, until it stood directly
on the border of the gulch, where, at a hundred yards
distant, and with the clear sunlight bathing him, every outline
was distinctly visible.</p>

<p>But it was not the horse, but that which was upon it, that
so excited the wonder and speculations of those who saw
him. Close scrutiny gave it the appearance of an animal
standing upon all-fours upon the back of the horse, like Barnum&#8217;s
trained goat Alexis. It was, however, three times the
size of that sagacious creature, and an Indian blanket was
thrown over it, so that little more than the general outlines
could be discerned.</p>

<p>This enveloping blanket reached to the neck of the &#8220;what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
is it?&#8221; leaving the head entirely exposed. This was round,
and bullet-shaped, and moved in that restless, nervous way
peculiar to animals. It seemed as black as coal, and resembled
the head of one of those giant gorillas which Du
Chaillu ran against in the wilds of Central Africa.</p>

<p>A strange chill crept over the two men, as they felt that
this animal was looking steadily down upon the encampment,
as if meditating a charge upon it, and only waiting to select
the most vulnerable point.</p>

<p>The steed supporting this nondescript stood neither directly
facing nor broadside toward the whites&mdash;but in such a position
that their view could not have been better. The horse
remained as stationary and motionless as if he were an image
carved in bronze.</p>

<p>No other living creature being in sight, the eyes of the little
band of defenders in Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch were speedily
fixed upon this strange phenomenon, and its movements were
watched with an intensity of interest which it would be hard
to describe.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is some Comanche deviltry,&#8221; was the remark of Egbert
Rodman, after he had surveyed the object for several minutes.
&#8220;They have grown tired of running against our bullets, and
are about to try some other means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what sort of means is that?&#8221; asked the captain, who
beyond question was a little nervous over what he saw.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is rather hard to tell, until we have some more developments;
but you know that the red-skins, from their
earliest history, have been noted for their ingenious tricks, by
which they have outwitted their foes, and you may depend
upon it that this is one of their contrivances, although I must
say that I do not see the necessity for any such labored attempts
as that, when they have every thing their own way;
and, if they would only make a united and determined
charge, we should all go under to a dead certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Shields, however, like many of the bravest men,
was superstitious, and he was inclined to believe that there
was something supernatural in the appearance of this thing,
and, although he hesitated to say so, yet he looked upon it as
having a most direful significance concerning himself and his
friends.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>Still the horse remained perfectly motionless, and the
quadruped, with the blanket thrown over his back, was steadily
gazing down upon them, from his perch upon the back
of another quadruped.</p>

<p>The profound stillness that then reigned over the prairie
and in Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch was rather deepened by the sound
of the faintest, most distant report of a gun that seemed to
have come from some point miles and miles away, in the direction
of Fort Adams, proving plainly that the pursuit of
the flying messenger was not yet given over.</p>

<p>Egbert Rodman concluded that there was a very easy and
speedy way of settling the business of convincing the awed
captain that there was nothing possessed by this curious animal
that was not the common possession of his race. As
he stood, partly turned toward him, he could not have desired
a better target for a carefully aimed rifle, and he determined
to tumble him from the back of the horse, and thus put a
speedy end to that bugbear of the captain&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Without saying a word as to his intentions, he carefully
thrust the muzzle of his rifle through the aperture in the
canvas of the wagon, and sighted at about where he supposed
the seat of life to be. He held his aim only long enough to
make certain, and then pulled the trigger and looked out to
see the &#8220;what is it?&#8221; pitch to the ground, and reveal his particular
identity in his death-struggles before their eyes.</p>

<p>But what did he see? The creature, standing in precisely
the same posture, and looking steadily down upon them, as
unmoved as though such a thing as a gun had never been invented.</p>

<p>But Egbert, although very much astounded, was not yet
prepared to admit that the nondescript was impregnable
against a good Springfield rifle, even if those about him were
under a superstitious spell.</p>

<p>And so, with the same steadiness of eye and nerve, he
reached out and took a second rifle from beside him, and
shoved this through the &#8220;port hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same unexceptionable target remained, and he resolved
that this time there should be no failure. He was a good
marksman, and he made certain aim, while more than one
breathlessly watched the result.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<p>The same as before! Not a sign of the thing being
harmed in the least!</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoot no more!&#8221; said Captain Shields, in an awed voice,
&#8220;there is nothing mortal about it! It is sent to warn us of
what is so close at hand!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER XIII.</span> <span class="smaller">&#8220;THE COMANCHES ARE COMING.&#8221;</span></h2>

<p>When Egbert Rodman fired and missed the second time
at the apparition at the top of the gulch, his emotions were
certainly of the most uncomfortable kind.</p>

<p>He was now certain that in both instances he had hit it
fairly and plumbly in the very point aimed at, and it was
equally certain that he had not harmed it in any way.</p>

<p>The mustang did not stir an inch, nor did any movement
upon the part of its strange rider indicate that he or it was
sensible of the slightest disturbance from the two bullets that
had been aimed at its life. Clearly then it was useless to
waste any more precious ammunition upon it, when it was
simply throwing it away.</p>

<p>Still Egbert was too intelligent and well educated to share
fully the belief of Captain Shields, although he could not
avoid a cold chill, as he proceeded to load his two discharged
pieces, for, to say the least, it was inexplicable, and no man
can feel at ease when face to face with a danger which
proves to be invulnerable against effort upon his part.</p>

<p>With the exception of Egbert, the other men believed the
same as did their captain, and the vim and spirit that had
marked their courageous defense up to this point, now deserted
them, as the sad, despairing conviction imparted itself
to each, that all hope was now gone, and they had but to
wait the coming of inevitable doom.</p>

<p>The mustang with the moveless apparition upon it deepened
the spell of terror that rested upon the whites, by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>starting
down the hill in the direction of the encampment. He
walked with a slow, deliberate tread, like a war-horse stepping
at the funeral of his master, and it may be said that the
blood of the staring bordermen froze in terror at the sight.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly their senses would so far have left them, that
they either would have dashed out of the gulch, or cowered
down in terror behind their barricades, like children frightened
at the approach of some hobgoblin.</p>

<p>But this last great calamity was spared them; for, while
yet at a considerable distance, the mustang came to a sudden
and dead halt, paused a moment, and then, with a snort of
alarm, turned about and dashed away at headlong speed.</p>

<p>The mustang was gone so speedily that there were many
who were not aware of the manner in which he had made
his exit, and were ready to believe that he had vanished like
a vision of the night, a proceeding in perfect keeping with
their idea of the phenomenon itself.</p>

<p>The hours dragged wearily by until noon came and passed,
and not a sign of an Indian had been seen, nor had the
frightful apparition reappeared. When the survivors saw
that the sun had really crossed the meridian, there were several
who began to feel the faintest revival of hope, while one
or two were inclined to believe that the Comanches had
withdrawn in a body and would be seen no more, discouraged
by the desperate resistance they had encountered, and the escape
of the messenger, and the probable coming of a body of
cavalry from Fort Adams.</p>

<p>While Egbert Rodman could not share in this belief, yet,
to relieve the suspense which oppressed all, he determined to
pass outside the encampment and learn whether or not there
was any foundation for such belief.</p>

<p>Of course, great risk was incurred by doing this, but all
had become used to risks, and he leaped from the wagon and
ran at quite a rapid rate up the hill, the entire group watching
him with an interest scarcely less than that with which
they had scrutinized the approach of the apparition.</p>

<p>The relaxation in the vigilance of the Indians had been
taken advantage of by the whites, especially by the women
and children, the latter of whom, with the innocence of their
age, were running back and forth and frolicking, with as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
much gayety as if playing upon the green at home, with no
thought of death in their minds.</p>

<p>&#8220;That chap will never get any sense in his head till it is
put there by a bullet,&#8221; remarked Captain Shields, as he stood
attentively watching his young friend, secretly admiring, in
spite of his words, the intrepidity which he had displayed
from the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you permit him to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens! I didn&#8217;t permit it; the first thing I knew,
I seen him jump out of the wagon and start up the hill.
Didn&#8217;t I try to stop him when he was after the red devil
with his canteen, and what good did it do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me that it would be so easy for him to run
directly to his death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it would, and for that matter, it would be powerful
easy for any of us to do the same; but he&#8217;s about to the top
of the gulch,&#8221; added the captain, turning away to watch his
progress.</p>

<p>Such was the case, and every voice was now hushed, and
every eye was fixed upon Rodman, as he slackened his gait,
and, stooping down, made his way as stealthily to the top of
the declivity as the most veteran scout could have done.</p>

<p>When he should reach there and look around, all knew
that he would give a signal which, indeed, would be that of
life or death to them.</p>

<p>They marked him as he crept on his hands and knees to
the very top, and then, removing his cap, peered over. Then
he rose partly to his feet and turned his head in different directions,
and just as the trembling whites were beginning to
take heart again, he suddenly wheeled about, and came running
down the gulch like a madman, waving his hand and
shouting something to his friends which was incomprehensible
from his very excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back to the wagon, every one of you!&#8221; commanded
Captain Shields, turning to the women. &#8220;Don&#8217;t wait a second!
That means that the Comanches are coming! To
your stations, boys, and let us die like men!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<h2><span>CHAPTER XIV.</span> <span class="smaller">THE LAST DAY IN DEAD MAN&#8217;S GULCH.</span></h2>

<p>Only a few seconds and Egbert Rodman was in the middle
of the encampment, breathless and wild.</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole horde of Indians are coming back!&#8221; he called
out, as soon as he could frame the words. &#8220;They are but a
short distance away and will be here in the next minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words had scarcely been uttered when the borders of
the gulch were swarming with yelling Comanches. The
women had barely time to scramble under shelter, when the
red-skins were upon them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire, as you can load and aim!&#8221; called out Captain
Shields, while yet his men were leaping to their places.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t wait, but let them have it! We may as well die
fighting like men!&#8221;</p>

<p>Crack! crack! barked the rifles of the scouts, in a regular
fusillade among the horsemen, the fatal results being instantly
seen, in the Comanches here and there dropping from the
backs of their mustangs.</p>

<p>This destructive fire accomplished the best thing possible,
in that it prevented the wholesale charge that was so much
to be dreaded; as it could not fail to be deadly fatal almost
on the instant.</p>

<p>The incessant sleet of bullets sent into the ranks of the
red-skins created an unexpected confusion, and just as our
friends had reached the last round of their ammunition, they
fell back out of range, and dismounting, crept to the edge of
the gulch and began firing down upon the encampment, just
as the scouts themselves would have done had the position
been reversed.</p>

<p>Despite the exaggerated assertion of the startled Egbert, as
he dashed into the camp, Captain Shields became well satisfied
from the glimpse he had gained, that the Comanche
force was divided, and he was now fighting against only a
portion of those against whom he had been pitted before, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
others, as he rightly suspected, having followed on in the
pursuit of the flying messenger, and with the purpose of entrapping
and ambuscading the cavalry that would be sent, in
all probability, to the rescue of the little band of whites.</p>

<p>But there was little consolation to be derived from this
discovery, as there were certainly over a hundred Comanches
at hand, and they unquestionably had the power, when they
should choose to put it forth, to crush out of existence himself
and every one of his brave men. One single determined
charge, a few minutes&#8217; appalling conflict around the wagons,
and then not a man need be left to tell the awful tale of the
last appalling massacre of Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch.</p>

<p>The red-skins kept up the cautious policy of lying flat upon
their faces, just over the edge of the ravine, and aiming
deliberately down into the encampment. By this time the
canvas of the wagons was riddled, and knowing pretty well
at what points to aim, the greatest caution was necessary upon
the part of the scouts to escape the bullets that were flying
all about them.</p>

<p>Fully a dozen of these merciless wretches directed their
exclusive attention to the wagon which they knew contained
the helpless members of the party, and such a steady fire was
kept up on it that the canvas in a few minutes looked like a
sieve, pierced in every part by bullets, many of which imbedded
themselves in the impenetrable planks of which the
wagon-body was composed.</p>

<p>This was the first time since the opening of this dreadful
siege that such a demonstration was made, and the unrelenting
malignity which characterized it, excited the wonder of
the scouts, who believed that the Comanches were so infuriated
at the losses already suffered, that some of the survivors
who may have lost their closest relatives, were bent upon exterminating
every one, man, woman and child, without awaiting
what might be considered the inevitable capture of the
females.</p>

<p>But provision had been made against this very thing from
the first. The sides of the vehicle, behind the canvas, had
been walled up with packages and bundles, in such a skillful
fashion, that so long as the little party could be made to keep
between them and near the center of the wagon-body, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
were as impervious to the rifle-shots as if incased in an ironclad
of the navy.</p>

<p>This steady stream of fire from the boundary of the gulch
continued until the greater portion of the day had passed.
So long as it continued without any concentration upon the
part of the Comanches, Captain Shields was satisfied, for
nothing short of a cannonade could demolish the barricades
that had withstood such a terrific fire for so many hours.</p>

<p>With the sole purpose of preventing any <i>coup d&#8217;état</i> upon
the part of the red-skins, the intrepid captain called to his
men to send a shot among them now and then, taking care,
however, that in every case the rifleman discharged his gun
at a fair target.</p>

<p>These opportunities, fortunately for our friends, were few,
and they were thus saved the fatal revelation that could have
had but one terrible result upon the part of the valiant defenders.</p>

<p>Captain Shields was thus kept so incessantly employed,
both in body and mind, that he had little time in which to
think of the apparition, and the ominous warning which he
fervently believed it foreshadowed; but, now and then, in
the heat of the conflict, it came to him with its dreadful depression
of spirits, and made him sigh and wish that the
&#8220;last minute&#8221; would come and the agony end.</p>

<p>This fearful fire continued until darkness descended upon
the prairie, and when the light failed, a lull came so sudden
as to cause a ringing and peculiar lightness of the head that
almost drove away the senses of those that remained.</p>

<p>Captain Shields waited a few minutes, and finding a possibility
of this quiet lasting for a short time, he determined
to make the round, and exchange a few words with his
friends. He was alone in the wagon which he had chosen
for his sentry-box, and stealing cautiously out, he hurried
across the clearing to that containing the women and children.
He found them stunned, paralyzed and nearly dead
from the awful ordeal through which they had passed, but a
little inquiry proved them all untouched by the bullets that
had been sent so inhumanly after them.</p>

<p>Then he made the rounds of the other vehicles, and a
blood-chilling discovery awaited him. Out of the five <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>defenders
besides himself, only one, Egbert Rodman, remained
alive, the other four having been struck and killed by the
balls of the Comanches!</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the use?&#8221; said the stunned officer as he took the
hand of the young man and helped him out upon the green
sward; &#8220;we two are the only ones left, and I have fired my
last round of ammunition, even to my pistols.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I,&#8221; returned Egbert; &#8220;we may as well go to the
women and die defending them. The last moment is at
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is here!&#8221; said Captain Shields, in a clear voice.
&#8220;Look! there they come!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he pointed up the sides of the gulch, where,
in the dim light of the early night, the horsemen were seen
gathering for the final charge. The next moment it came!</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER XV.</span> <span class="smaller">THE RESCUE.</span></h2>

<p>The next moment a strange, wild yell broke the stillness,
or rather sounded above the thunder of the horses&#8217; hoofs, and
the two men, standing sullenly by the wagon in the center
of the encampment, and awaiting their doom, like those who,
having done all that was possible, could now do nothing
else.</p>

<p>Again that indescribable yell rung out over the prairie, and
Captain Shields straightened himself like a flash, and gave a
gasp of amazement if not terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear that, Egbert?&#8221; he demanded, clutching the
arm of the half-stupefied man at his side. &#8220;By heavens!
they are not Indians, but Lightning Jo and his men from
Fort Adams!&#8221;</p>

<p>The next minute the clearing within the encampment was
filled by a score of men, who, leaping from their horses, and
leaving them outside of the circle of wagons, came rushing
in upon the little party from every direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helloa! here, where are you?&#8221; shouted the famous scout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
&#8220;this ain&#8217;t a game of hide and seek. Come out and show
yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was uttered in a cheery, hearty way, but mingled
with the voice could have been detected a tone of awe and
dread, like one who in reality was afraid to hear the same
answer which he had demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; replied Captain Shields, as he and Rodman
walked forward to meet their deliverers.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the rest of you&mdash;where are they? Speak quick, old
fellow,&#8221; added Jo, taking the hand of the two, both of whom
were his acquaintances; &#8220;we are in a hurry, and want to
hear all that is to be heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There they are,&#8221; returned Egbert, pointing to the wagons;
&#8220;some are beneath them, and some are within them, but
every one is dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Lightning Jo; &#8220;you had women and
children with you&mdash;they are not all gone? I heard that
Lizzie Manning, the sweetest little girl in Santa Fe, or anywhere
else, was with you. Where is <i>she</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she is all right,&#8221; returned Captain Shields, who had
misunderstood the full import of the question; &#8220;they are unharmed.&#8221;</p>

<p>But by this time Gibbons, who knew just where to look
for them, called out that they were safe, and he and many of
the soldiers gathered about the wagon to congratulate and
give them what assistance was in their power.</p>

<p>Their kindnesses were needed, for during the latter portion
of this day all had suffered the most agonizing thirst, the
scant supply which had been furnished them so unexpectedly
lasting them but a short time, and then seeming to intensify
that intolerable craving that drives the strongest man mad,
until all were overcome by a sort of stupor, in which they
were sensible only of dull, yearning pain, that could not be
quieted.</p>

<p>Expecting as much, the soldiers were prepared, and more
than one canteen of cool, refreshing, delicious and reviving
water was offered to the suffering women and children, and
almost instantly new life was imparted to all, and they awoke
to a realizing sense of their position, and to the fact that
they had been rescued.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are you there, Lizzie?&#8221; asked Lightning Jo, crowding
forward, and peering among the group, who were dismounting
from the vehicle that had proven such a friendly shelter
and fort to them. &#8220;Helloa! I see you! Thank the good
Lord! I was very much afeard I&#8217;d be too late to save your
sweet self.&#8221;</p>

<p>And taking the half-fainting girl in his long, brawny arms,
he pressed her to his heart and kissed her cheek, just as affectionately
and gratefully as he would have done had she been
his only daughter restored to life.</p>

<p>And poor Lizzie, now that she saw that the awful danger
had passed, could not prevent her woman&#8217;s nature from asserting
itself. Resting her head upon the bosom of the brave-hearted
scout, she could only sob in the utter abandonment
of feeling. She knew that so long as Lightning Jo stood
near her there was nothing to be feared from any mortal
danger that walked this earth; and the tense point to which
her mind had been strung for so long a time, now fully reacted,
and she became as weak and helpless as the youngest
of the children, who were beginning to awake from their
stupor. And so, without attempting to speak, she simply
sobbed, and allowed her friend to support her in his arms.</p>

<p>The rest of the cavalry were not idle. They made a circuit
of the wagons, and, as they learned the dreadful truth,
something like a heart-sickness and awe quieted their boisterous
voices, and they conversed in low tones, some muttering
curses against the red scourges of the plains, while others expressed
their sympathy for the brave men who had perished
before relief came.</p>

<p>The life of the soldiers on the frontier is such as to accustom
them to the most revolting evidences of the cruelty of
the Indians; but there were thoughts that were suggested to
the cavalry, by the sight in Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch, such as did
not often come to them.</p>

<p>The long-continued and heroic defense of the little party,
the torment of thirst, the vain attacks of the ferocious Comanches,
the unflinching bravery of men and women, the
steady dropping of the scouts until only ten were left, the
total giving out of the ammunition, and then the sullen despair,
in which the last defenders awaited the last charge:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
these pictures came to the minds of the cavalrymen in more
vivid colors than they can to the reader who has seen nothing
of the wild, daring life of the frontier.</p>

<p>Gibbons quickly told his story to his friends. After the
diversion created by Lightning Jo&#8217;s scrimmage with the Comanches
among the hills, he and his men had put their horses
to the full run, and reached the neighborhood of Dead Man&#8217;s
Gulch just as the lull in the conflict occurred. It was their
purpose to charge down upon the red-skins, and give them a
taste of vengeance, such as they had not yet encountered;
but the cautious Swico had his scouts out, and the approach
of the cavalry was signaled to him while they were yet a long
way off.</p>

<p>In the hope of still accomplishing something, the majority
of the cavalry started in pursuit of the Comanches, while
Lightning Jo and a score of his friends hurried on to Dead
Man&#8217;s Gulch, where the chief interest now lay.</p>

<p>The horses of the soldiers were already exhausted, and
they were speedily compelled to return, after having exchanged
a few shots with the band of Swico-Cheque, as they skurried
away in the darkness.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER XVI.</span> <span class="smaller">HOMEWARD BOUND.</span></h2>

<p>There were too many horrors hanging around Dead Man&#8217;s
Gulch for the whites to spend any more time there than was
necessary. Several of the wagons were overturned upon each
other, and then fired, and by the aid of this huge bonfire,
which sent a glow out upon the prairie for miles, like the
rays of the Eddystone light-house over the ocean, they set
about their work of mercy.</p>

<p>In one of the wagons were placed all the bodies of those
who had fallen, and the other was fitted up in the most comfortable
manner for the women and children. To these several
of the cavalry attached their horses, and making sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
that every thing that could be of any possible use to the Comanches
was burned, the rescuing party started out of the
ravine, which was ever afterward to cause a shudder whenever
memory recalled the awful experiences to which they
were there doomed.</p>

<p>The moon had only fairly risen when the procession slowly
wended its way out from the gulch, and off across the prairie,
in the direction of Fort Adams. They were indeed what
they looked to be, a funeral procession, and another vivid
comment upon the terrible errors which have governed the
associations of the white and red-men from the very first
meeting, nearly four hundred years ago.</p>

<p>The dragging of the two heavily-laden wagons across the
prairie could but be a tedious and wearisome task, and in all
probability would not be completed until the second day after
starting. Of course there was a possibility that Swico would
return to the attack, if a suitable occasion should offer, but it
was not deemed necessary that the entire one hundred men
should remain to escort them into the fort.</p>

<p>And so when the eighty rode back from the fruitless pursuit
of the main body of Indians, the arrangements were
made for dividing the company, it being well known that
Colonel Greaves could ill afford to spare so many men, and
would be pleased if such a course could be carried out without
any ill results flowing therefrom.</p>

<p>But, first of all, the steeds and their riders needed rest after
the tremendous charge over the prairie, and less than a mile
from Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch, where a sparkling stream of cold
water wandered through a grove of trees, the camp was made
for the night, the sentinels being stationed at every point, and
such precautions made, as to cause every one to feel perfectly
safe against any disturbance from the malignant red-skins,
who had too much discretion to rush in where they knew
they would be only too gladly received by the cavalry.</p>

<p>Several fires were kindled in the grove, and food cooked,
the camping-ground being one of the most pleasant that could
possibly have been chosen, as there was an abundance of rich
grass for their animals, and every thing that could be needed
by their riders.</p>

<p>At one of these fires, a little apart from the rest, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
three persons, engaged in the most pleasant converse. The
long, lank figure, stretched lazily upon the ground, supporting
himself upon his elbow, was Lightning Jo, at his ease,
with his nature all &#8220;unbent&#8221; and his humorous self at the
surface. As he talked, his black eyes sparkled, and his handsome
white teeth were constantly exposed as he asked some
question, or made some reply to Egbert Rodman and Lizzie
Manning, who were seated upon the opposite side of the fire,
rather closer together than was absolutely necessary, chatting
with each other and with the scout, who kept &#8220;chaffing&#8221;
them so continuously that they had little opportunity for any
private conference of their own.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may as well wait, younkers,&#8221; said Jo. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
object to you squeezing each other&#8217;s hands, jest as you tried
a minute ago, when you thought I warn&#8217;t looking; but you
needn&#8217;t try to talk to each other when I&#8217;m about. So wait,
I tell yer, till some other time, for you ain&#8217;t going to get rid
of me till you bunk up for the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one wants to get rid of you,&#8221; retorted Lizzie, as a
blush suffused her face, and her eyes sparkled in the firelight.
&#8220;What do we care for you? I have no wish for any private
talk with Egbert.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not; nor he with you; any fool can see that
in both your looks, &#8217;specially in his. But that&#8217;s always the
way. I had an aunt once that always was interfering when
any young dunces got to fooling round. She had a son, that
she thought all the world of. He had learned the shoemaker&#8217;s
trade, and when he was about forty or forty-five, he got
tender on a cross-eyed girl, with red hair, that lived near
him, and he went for her. My aunt didn&#8217;t like it a bit, and
done all she could to break it up. She said if her boy would
wait till he got to be a man, she wouldn&#8217;t object, if he would
pick out a young lady for her worth instead of for her beauty,
as he had done. She done every thing to torment the poor
feller, giving him medicine to make him sick when he had a
special appointment with her, sewing big patches all over his
coat, so that he was ashamed to wear it, and locking him in
his room and giving him a good strapping when he got sassy
and gave her any of his lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin Josh didn&#8217;t mind that much, as he said the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
woman had been a little peculiar ever since he had been
&#8217;quainted with her; but there was one thing that he couldn&#8217;t
get used to, and that was her way of bouncing down upon
him and his senorita, just as they were beginning to act like
you two folks, and thought nobody wasn&#8217;t looking on.
Three times, Josh told me, he had got down on his knees
and clasped his hands and shut his eyes, and was making his
proposal to his lady, and was just in the sweetest part, when
he opened his eyes and saw his mother standing afore him
with a sweet smile upon her countenance, and more than
once, when he reached out his arm to put around the young
lady&#8217;s waist, it went over the old woman&#8217;s neck, who was alistening
near, and who cuffed his ears for being such a
fool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Josh stood it as long as he could, but finally he got even
with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; inquired Egbert.</p>

<p>&#8220;He got a big skyrocket made, and fastened it to the old
lady&#8217;s dress, and got a little boy to touch off the fuse. The
last seen of my aunt she was whizzing and bobbing through
the air, until she went out of sight. As she never came
down ag&#8217;in, Josh wasn&#8217;t bothered any more, and he went on
with his courtship and at last got married and lived happy,
as such a good boy deserved to be.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER XVII.</span> <span class="smaller">ON THE BRINK.</span></h2>

<p>The sentinels on duty at the grove detected more than
once through the night the Comanches prowling around the
encampment; but they evidently saw enough to convince
them that it wouldn&#8217;t pay to disturb the sleepers, and so they
slept on, on, till the bright summer sun pierced the camp,
and all was active again. Then, as the preparations were
made for resuming the journey to Fort Adams, and a careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
reconnaissance of the surrounding prairie was made, not a
shadow of a red-skin could be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in hopes that I could get a crack at Swico,&#8221; remarked
Lightning Jo, as he rode at the head of the company,
with Egbert Rodman and Lizzie Manning by his side, he insisting
upon her keeping him company when no danger was
thereby incurred, as he declared there was no telling when
such an opportunity would be given him again, and, as a
matter of course, she was only too happy to comply with his
wishes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was saying that I had hopes of getting even with
Swico, and he and me have an account that must be squared
one of these days, but I wasn&#8217;t given the chance to draw a
bead on his shadow. Howsumever, we&#8217;ll get square one of
these days, as my uncle used to remark when he cheated me
out of my last cent, and then kicked me out doors when I
asked him for a trifle. They&#8217;ve got some purty big devils
among the Comanches, but I think Swico goes ahead of &#8217;em
all. Do you know what sort of ornament he has made for
himself, and which he thinks more of than any thing he ever
had?&#8221;</p>

<p>The two replied that they had never heard mention of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wears a shirt of buck-skin, made without the usual
ornaments of beads and porcupine-quills, but hung with a full,
long fringe <i>formed from the hair of white women and children</i>!
You needn&#8217;t look so horrified,&#8221; the scout hastened to add, as
he noted the expression upon the faces of his friends. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
sent word to Swico that him and me could never square accounts
till I got hold of that same thing, and I never can get
hold of it till I wipe the owner out, so you can see how <i>that</i>
thing has got to be settled atween us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you hadn&#8217;t come to Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch as you did,
that fringe would have been ornamented with <i>my</i> tresses,&#8221;
said Lizzie, looking with an awed, grateful look at her preserver.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; was the matter-of-fact reply; &#8220;the old scamp
was expecting me, and I wonder that he waited. But he
sloped when some of his scouts sent him word that we was
coming. Howsumever, what&#8217;s the use of talking? I don&#8217;t
see as you&#8217;ve got any reason to think any thing about him.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you suppose this Comanche chief and his band
are now?&#8221; inquired Egbert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Off over the prairie somewhere, looking for more women
and children. That&#8217;s his <i>forte</i>, as they say down in Santa
Fe, and I rather reckon that there are plenty more in the
same boat with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The subject, at the present time, seemed distasteful to
Lightning Jo. The fight was over, and he considered all
danger at an end, and despite the bier, with its awful load,
that followed in the rear of the cavalcade, he seemed to feel
a certain buoyancy of spirits that was constantly struggling
for expression in his words and manner.</p>

<p>The morning was clear and bracing, and but for the lumbering
wagons the whole party would have been bounding
forward at a rate that would have carried them to Fort
Adams within the next few hours.</p>

<p>No interruption occurred until noon, when a halt was
made for dinner, the cavalry being provided with sufficient
rations to make it unnecessary to use the rifle in quest of
game.</p>

<p>By the middle of the afternoon, they were within a dozen
miles of the fort; and, as there had been no signs of Indians
visible since starting in the morning, it was concluded to be
no violation of prudence for the main body to gallop on to
their destination, leaving the wagons to follow at their leisure,
it being confidently expected that they would come into the
stockade shortly after nightfall.</p>

<p>Lightning Jo and a dozen of the best men, including Gibbons,
Captain Shields and Rodman, remained with the
smaller party. All were mounted, fully armed and provided
with an abundance of ammunition, so that no one felt any
misgiving as to the result of this proceeding, which at first
sight might seem imprudent in the highest degree. In case
any formidable body of Indians should put in an appearance,
and it was deemed best to avoid a fight, the wagons could be
abandoned, and the women and children taken upon the
horses with the men, and the flight would be as rapid and
sure as could be desired.</p>

<p>Nothing but the sternest necessity could induce Lightning
Jo and his party to abandon their dead friends to mutilation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and outrage at the hands of the Comanches; but they deemed
that necessity so remote as scarcely to require a thought,
and so they separated, and the main body rapidly vanished
from view.</p>

<p>A few miles further on, the prairie was broken up in ridges
and hills of such size as to merit the name of mountains,
and Jo declared that several miles could be saved by passing
through these. He had done so several times, and knew of
a pass through which the wagons could be drawn with as
much ease as upon the open plain.</p>

<p>Before entering this, however, he displayed his usual caution
by galloping ahead and making a reconnaissance, from
which he returned with the announcement that nothing in
the shape of Indians was to be feared.</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems to be a heavy storm coming,&#8221; he added, as
he glanced up at the darkening sky, &#8220;but we can stand that
in the mountains as well as upon the prairies; so let&#8217;s go
ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the little company rode into the ravine, and marked
the ominous gathering of the elements, more than one was
sensible of a singular depression of spirits&mdash;a strange, chilling
foreboding such as sometimes comes over us when standing
beneath some impending calamity.</p>

<p>And indeed, had Lightning Jo suspected the appalling
danger which was already gathering over his brave band, he
would have gone a thousand miles before venturing a rod
into that ravine!</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER XVIII.</span> <span class="smaller">SHUT IN.</span></h2>

<p>The little party of horsemen had scarcely begun their passage
through the hills, when it became evident that they were
to encounter the storm of which Lightning Jo had spoken.
The warm air became of chilly coldness, and blew in fitful
gusts against their faces, the sky was rapidly overcast by dark,
sweeping clouds, and the rumbling thunder approached nigher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and nigher, rolling up from the horizon like the &#8220;chariot-wheels
over the court of heaven,&#8221; while the forked lightning
darted in and out from the inky masses, like streams of
blood. A few screeching birds went skurrying away in a
cloud of dust, and the appearance of every thing left no doubt
of the elemental tumult that was on the eve of breaking forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to catch it, you bet,&#8221; remarked Jo, as he
looked up at the marshaling of Nature&#8217;s forces, clapping his
hands to the top of his head, as if fearful that his cap would
be whirled out of sight by the tornado-like gust of wind,
&#8220;but it would be worse out on the perarie than down here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had to shout to make himself heard, although the lovers,
Egbert and Lizzie, were riding close to him.</p>

<p>The former shouted back the return in the question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we not find shelter before the storm comes? We
shall all be drenched to the skin, if we are exposed to the
deluge for the space of five minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, we can find shelter, and that&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m
going for this minute. We&#8217;ll make it afore the deluge comes.
If we&#8217;d been on the perarie we&#8217;d had to hold our hair on,
and we&#8217;d have got such a basting that it would have taken a
lifetime to git over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we have found shelter in the wagons?&#8221; yelled
Egbert.</p>

<p>Jo&#8217;s face could be seen to expand in a grin, as he made
answer in the same vociferous tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shelter in the wagons? I&#8217;ve seen that tried afore&mdash;when
the covering was slathered to ribbons in the wink of an
eye and the wagons went rolling over and over like a log, going
down the side of a mountain till they went out of sight, and
when we rid our hosses &#8217;long over that same route, we made
our camp-fires with bits of wagon for the next fifty miles. I
reckon you haven&#8217;t had a storm sin&#8217; you left St. Louey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly nothing like <i>that</i>,&#8221; was the answer of Rodman,
who thought the scout was drawing things with rather a
&#8220;long bow.&#8221; &#8220;We had several storms, such as struck us all
as being very severe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;S&#8217;pose you thought so; but they were the gentlest of
zephyrs alongside of some that I&#8217;ve butted ag&#8217;in&#8217;. I came
over the plains with a party in &#8217;48, when I was purty young,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and took my first degree in perarie storms then. We were
&#8217;bout a hundred miles out of St. Louey, when we butted ag&#8217;in&#8217;
a dead head-wind, that got so strong that we see&#8217;d purty soon
we shouldn&#8217;t be able to stand. When I see&#8217;d how things
was going, and that my hoss was a-slipping backward, I
jumped off my hoss, and laid down flat on my face and held
onto the ground; but it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no use. I see&#8217;d my animal
going end over end over the plain, looking like a dough-nut
turning summersets, and, finding I was blowing loose, I
crawled into the wagon in the tallest kind of a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there you were safe,&#8221; remarked Egbert, knowing
that something stunning was at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I rather think we was,&#8221; he answered, ironically.
&#8220;When I crawled into the ox-wagon, I found all the rest
war there, and the old shebang was already going backward,
and gaining every second like a steam-engine. You see the
wind was dead ahead, and the cover of the wagon acted like
a sail, and it warn&#8217;t long afore we was a going over the perarie
at a rate that you never dreamed of. You can just bet
things hummed. I looked out of the side of the coach, and
see&#8217;d the wagon-wheels going round so fast that you couldn&#8217;t
see any thing but the hubs, and they had a misty sort of look,
from buzzing round in such style. Some of the women got
a little nervous, and said they preferred to ride at a little
slower gait, and axed me, if it was all the same to me, if I
wouldn&#8217;t shut off a little steam. All I could do was to put
on the brakes, and the minute I done that, I see&#8217;d a flash and
they was gone!&mdash;jist like a pinch of powder&mdash;burned up by
the friction.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I told the folks to compose themselves, as I reckoned
we war in for it, and we&#8217;d all go to pieces together. Well,
now, that shebang kept going faster and faster. I jist tell
you things buzzed for awhile. I looked out the tail of the
wagon (we war going tail foremost) and see&#8217;d ourselves going
right straight for Devil&#8217;s Humps&mdash;which you know is two
mountain peaks, something like a quarter of a mile apart.
Thinking every thing was up, I jist scrooched down in the
wagon and watched to see ourselves go. I s&#8217;pose you will
think I&#8217;m exaggerating, when I tell you we went right up
the first mountain-peak, which was half a mile high, as quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
as a wink, but there the wagon struck a rock, turned summersets;
but it was going so fast that it shot right across
from one peak to another, and happening to light right side
up, we kept straight on for St. Louey. That &#8217;ere jump from
one mount to another rather mixed us up, and some of the
women complained of being jarred a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Howsumever, we got straightened up after a bit, and then
begun to watch things. I knowed there was fun ahead,
when I see&#8217;d a thundering big drove of cattle right in our
path. They tried to get out of our way, but they couldn&#8217;t,
and we went right through them like a cannon-shot, and
when I looked back I see&#8217;d a regular tunnel through the
drove of bufflers knocked to flinders. You see there was
several purty good-sized streams in our way, and when we
buzzed through them, some of us got our clothes a little moist,
but we had to let things go, and, to make a long story short,
we never held in until we reached St. Louey, where we shot
straight through the biggest hotel, and into an old lady&#8217;s cellar
afore we stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we was a little shook up, but that was nothing
to what we met next day&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lightning Jo suddenly paused, in the very middle of the
sentence, and his companions saw his face blanch, and his
eyes flash, as though he had caught sight of some new and
appalling danger.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER XIX.</span> <span class="smaller">THE TERROR OF THE PRAIRIE.</span></h2>

<p>There was no need of Lightning Jo telling what it was
that so startled him, for following the direction of his own
gaze, every eye saw it on the instant.</p>

<p>On the upper margin of the precipitous chasm or canon,
through which they were making their way, at a point about
a hundred feet above and directly over them, was the apparition
which had so startled Captain Shields when in Dead
Man&#8217;s Gulch. The mustang was standing as motionless as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
then, and the same quadrupedal nondescript was perched
upon his back, its black head turned a little to one side, while
it was evidently gazing down upon them with a fixed, intense
stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil will be to pay now,&#8221; growled Jo, just loud
enough to be heard in the roaring wind; &#8220;but it&#8217;s too late
to put back, and we&#8217;ll press ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>And resolutely compressing his lips, he drove his mustang
to the head of the cavalcade and forced him into a gallop
along the canon, the others, of course, following his example.</p>

<p>Neither Egbert nor Lizzie had made the least reference to
this apparition, while in converse with the scout, for the reason
that each knew he bore the reputation of being a practical
man, and would only laugh and tell them that it was a
&#8220;spook,&#8221; that their fright and sufferings caused to appear to
their own minds&mdash;an explanation which both were inclined
to accept up to this point.</p>

<p>But Jo had scarcely started ahead, when several large drops
of rain pattering here and there in the gorge, warned them that
the threatened deluge was at hand. The winding of the
canon, at the point over which they were now hurrying, was
such that there was comparatively little about them, although
it moaned and sobbed over their heads like the desolate wailing
of lost spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up, Jo!&#8221; yelled Gibbons, from directly in the rear
of the lovers, &#8220;or we shall be drenched!&#8221;</p>

<p>No need of shouting to the scout, who at that moment
made a dash a little to one side, and then wheeling his steed
squarely about, halted and motioned to the others to join
him on the instant.</p>

<p>The shelter was reached.</p>

<p>The horse of the scout stood on the same level with the
bottom of the canon; but, the rocky side of the latter, instead
of sloping perpendicularly upward, inclined far out over
their heads, so that the upper margin projected fully twenty
feet further over than did the base, thus giving them the very
protection for which they were so hastily seeking.</p>

<p>The party lost no time in arranging themselves beneath
this roof, and in a few minutes the two wagons came <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>lumbering
up, the horses forced to a much more rapid gait then
they had yet attempted.</p>

<p>They had barely time to reach the spot, when the bullet-like
drops that had been pattering faster and faster, suddenly
and prodigiously increased, and the storm broke forth.</p>

<p>The scene was fearfully sublime&mdash;and such as our pen
scarcely dare attempt to depict. The rain came down in such
blinding torrents that the top of the gorge was shut out from
the view of the whites, and a dim, watery twilight gloom enveloped
them all. The thunder, that had been somewhat
diminishing for the last few minutes, now burst forth in rattling,
tremendous discharges, as if heaven and earth were
coming together&mdash;while the vivid, intense lightning seemed
to be everywhere&mdash;rending rocks and trees, and playing along
the canon in its arrowy flight, setting the whole air aflame.</p>

<p>All stood awed and hushed&mdash;no one daring to break the
stillness, and scarcely moving during this war of the elements.
It seemed as if it were blasphemy for man to seek to speak
or interpose during the moments when nature herself was
speaking in such trumpet-like tones.</p>

<p>But the storm was as short as it was violent; and, as the
booming thunder retreated and gradually died away, in sullen
reverberations, the fall of rain slackened, and just as the afternoon
was drawing to a close, the last drop fell.</p>

<p>The appearance of the mustang and its strange rider seemed
to have produced a remarkable effect upon Lightning Jo, who
had lost all his vivacity and humor, and was thoughtful and
silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we to remain here all night or go forward?&#8221; asked
Egbert, walking to where Jo stood, leaning against the rocks,
with arms folded and moody brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go forward,&#8221; he replied, almost savagely, as he raised
himself. &#8220;What do we want to stay here for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it is nearly dark, and Fort Adams is still a number
of miles away. We shall not be able to reach there until far
into the night. Why not encamp where we are and finish
the journey leisurely in the morning? There seems to be no
particular danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you there <i>is</i> danger,&#8221; was the fierce reply of the
scout; &#8220;did you see that <i>Thing</i> on the mustang?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and I have seen it before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so have I, and I can tell yer it means something.
When that comes &#8217;round, there&#8217;s the worst kind of deviltry
close on to its heels; you can bet on <i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we are not yet through with the Indians, after believing
we were perfectly clear of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say <i>that</i>&mdash;but what I mean is that some deviltry
is brewing; we&#8217;re right in the middle of these hills, and the
best thing we can do is to get ahead while we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; exclaimed Lizzie Manning, in an awed voice;
&#8220;what is the meaning of <i>that</i>?&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER XX.</span> <span class="smaller">A FEARFUL RIDE.</span></h2>

<p>A dull, increasing roar, like the moaning of the Indian
Sea, when the cyclone is being born, struck the ears of the
whites, all of whom paused in their conversation and listened,
wondering what it meant.</p>

<p>The horses showed signs of restlessness and fear, but they
were held sternly in check, while the riders bent all their
faculties into that of hearing; and by a common instinct,
every eye was turned toward Lightning Jo, as if inquiring of
him an explanation of the strange sound.</p>

<p>What the scout thought can only be conjectured; but there
was a scared look upon his face that gave all the most gloomy
forebodings, and they awaited his words and actions with an
intensity of anxiety that can scarcely be described.</p>

<p>The roar, which now drowned every other sound, was like
that made by the approaching train, and it had that awful
element of terror which comes over one when he feels that a
peril is bearing swiftly down upon him from which there is
no escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Onto your hosses, every one of you! Cut &#8217;em loose from
the wagons, and don&#8217;t wait a minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice of Lightning Jo rung out like a trumpet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
was obeyed on the instant, while by another imperious command
of his, the women and children were taken upon the
backs of the animals in front of the hunters.</p>

<p>Quickly as all this was done, it was not a moment too soon.
In reply to the questioning looks of his friends, the scout
pointed up the ravine in the direction whence they had come.</p>

<p>At first sight, there seemed to be a mass of discolored snow
spinning down the canon; but the next moment all knew
that it was the foam and spray of water, rushing down upon
them with the impetuosity of a Niagara.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold fast!&#8221; called out Jo; &#8220;but there&#8217;s no use trying to
fight it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even while the words were in his mouth, the appalling
torrent came upon them!</p>

<p>There was a blinding dash of spray and mist, and then
every horse, with its rider, was carried as quick as a flash off
his feet, and shot down the canon like a meteor.</p>

<p>Egbert Rodman, the moment he realized the nature of the
danger, reached forward and caught the hand of Lizzie Manning,
intending to place her upon the horse, in front of him,
as many of the other scouts had done; but ere he could accomplish
the transfer, the shock was upon them, and in the stunning,
bewildering crash, he was only sensible of going forward
with tremendous velocity, down the canon, among his
friends, who were all impelled onward by the same resistless
force, that made them, for the time, like bits of driftwood
heaped in the vortex of the great maelstrom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lizzie! where are you?&#8221; he called out, in his agony,
groping blindly about him in the tornado of mist, and driftwood,
and water; &#8220;reach out your hand that I may save
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard something like an answering cry; but in the
rush and whirl, he could not tell the direction nor the point
whence it came; and had he known that only a half-dozen
feet separated them, it was no more in his power to pass the
chasm than it was for him to turn and make headway against
the <i>chute</i> that was carrying every thing before it with an inconceivable
velocity.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe the appalling scene in
the canon. Those who lived to tell of it, in after years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
shuddered at its recollection and declared that its terror was
greater than any through which they had ever passed. The
little group who sat waiting and conversing upon their horses
had scarcely been caught up and shot forward, when the
gloom of the approaching night deepened to that of the most
intense, inky blackness, so that no man, speaking literally,
could have seen his hand before his face.</p>

<p>It would have made no difference had it been high noon,
so far as the question of helping themselves was concerned,
although it might have lessened in some degree that shuddering,
shivering dread that possessed all, under the expectation
every moment of being dashed to fragments against the projecting
rocks, or crushed by the <i>debris</i> that was carried tumultuously
forward in the rush and whirl of the waters.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Stick to your hosses, and take things easy!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice of Lightning Jo seemed to come from a point a
thousand yards away&mdash;whether above or below could not be
told by the sound; but all knew that he was somewhere in
the torrent, and there was something reassuring in the sound
of his ringing voice in this general pandemonium of disaster
and death. It encouraged more than one despairing and helpless,
and they clung the more tightly and took some courage
and hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jo, can you hear my voice?&#8221; called out Egbert Rodman,
with the whole strength of his lungs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon so,&#8221; came back the instant answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, then, whether you have Lizzie with you, or
whether you know where she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; can&#8217;t tell; thought you and her were together.
We&#8217;ll fetch up somewhere purty soon&mdash;daylight will come in
the course of a week&mdash;and then we&#8217;ll hunt for each other.
No use till then&mdash;so you keep your mouth shet, and look out
that you don&#8217;t get your head cracked.&#8221;</p>

<p>These seemed heartless words to Egbert; but they were
really dictated by prudence and common sense, and he acted
upon the advice, so far as it concerned the questioning of the
scout.</p>

<p>The mustang of our young friend was swimming as well
as he could down the <i>chute</i>, striving only to keep himself
afloat. His body was beneath the water, his nose and head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
only appearing above. Up to this time Egbert had maintained
his place upon his back, himself sinking of course to
the armpits; but when he heard the warning words of
Lightning Jo, he understood how the projecting point of
some jagged rock might pass over his animal&#8217;s head, and
crush his own.</p>

<p>Accordingly he quietly slipped back over the animal&#8217;s
haunches, and submerging himself to his ears, held on to the
tail of the animal, in a position of greater safety&mdash;if such a
thing as safety can be named in reference to the party caught
by the torrent in the canon.</p>

<p>Egbert had scarcely adopted this precautionary measure,
when he had reason to thank Lightning Jo for the timely
warning.</p>

<p>Something grazed the top of his head, like the whiz of a
cannon-ball, proving with what amazing velocity he was shooting
down the canon.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can any one get out of this horrible place alive?&#8221;
was the question he asked, as he realized the narrowness of
his escape. &#8220;We must all be shattered to pieces before going
much further. Ah!&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a wild cry rung out above the din and roar of
the waters&mdash;the cry of a strong man in his last agony. Driven
as if by a columbiad against some flinty projection, he had
only time to make the shriek as the breath was driven from
his body.</p>

<p>As this spinning downward through the chasm continued
for several moments, Egbert endeavored to collect his senses
and to think more clearly upon his terrible position.</p>

<p>He was morally certain that a number of the party had already
lost their lives, and a twinge of anguish shot through
his heart as he reflected upon the females and the tender
children exposed to this perilous war of elements. And then,
too, the wagon containing the remains of those who had
fought so gallantly in Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch&mdash;what a ghastly
fate had overtaken them! It seemed, indeed, as if nature
had joined with man in heaping unimagined horrors upon the
heads of the weak and defenseless, and that nothing remained
but to await shudderingly the fate that could not be postponed
much longer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>But amid the rack and turmoil and swirl of the canon, the
thought of his beloved Lizzie Manning would present itself,
and he could not help wondering, doubting, fearing and hoping
all in the same breath.</p>

<p>Was she living and had she survived the ordeal uninjured
up to this time? Or had her gentle nature succumbed at the
first shock? She had proven herself a heroine in Dead
Man&#8217;s Gulch, and was she equal to this? If still living, how
much longer could she bear the strain upon her system?</p>

<p>But ere Egbert Rodman could conjecture any replies to
these questions, he was called upon to make a still more desperate
fight for his own life.</p>

<p>His mustang, encountering some obstruction, made such a
sudden, furious plunge, that his tail was drawn from the loose
grasp of Egbert, who, aiming to renew it, clutched vaguely
in the darkness and was unable to reach his faithful animal.
He could hear him floundering and neighing close at hand,
but there was no use of attempting to reach him, and he
called to the horse, in the hope that he would succeed in
making his way to him; but he was disappointed in this also,
for the noise of the struggles speedily ceased, and he concluded
that the faithful animal was dead.</p>

<p>Rather curiously the young man had clung to his rifle
ever since he was caught by the water tornado, and now that
he was somewhat cooler and more collected, he resolved that
nothing but &#8220;death should them part.&#8221; It was troublesome
to swim with it grasped in one hand, but he was quite able
to do it, where the current possessed such extraordinary velocity,
and he moved forward with little effort on his part.</p>

<p>All this passed in a tenth part of the time taken by us in
writing it, and Egbert Rodman had scarcely gained a connected
idea of what was going on, when he made the discovery
that the channel through which he had been dashed
was widening and considerably decreasing. The deafening
crash that had been in his ears from the moment he was carried
off his feet, now sunk to a dull noise, proving that he
had emerged from the canon, and was floating over what
might be termed a lake&mdash;caused, undoubtedly, by the widening
of the pass through which Lightning Jo had attempted
to guide the little party, with its two wagons.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>With this discovery of the comparative calmness of the
water, came, for the first time, something like returning hope
to Egbert Rodman, who, feeling confident that there must be
a tenable foothold at no great distance, began swimming forward
regularly, so as to avoid being carried around in a circle.</p>

<p>Of course such a basin as this must have an outlet as well
as an inlet, and it was his purpose to prevent himself being
carried away into another similar canon, from which it was
hardly possible to make such an escape over again.</p>

<p>This required severe effort, but happily it was accomplished
sooner than was expected. While swimming vigorously forward,
his feet touched bottom, and although scarcely able to
maintain his foothold, yet by using arms and legs and grasping
some branches that brushed his face, he succeeded in
drawing himself out upon land, and found himself free from
the flood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saved at last, and thank God for it!&#8221; was his fervent
ejaculation. &#8220;But what of the rest?&mdash;what of the women
and children? and Lizzie&mdash;where can she be?&#8221;</p>

<p>All was of inky darkness about him, and he hardly dared
to move for fear of plunging himself into some inextricable
pitfall. Only by feeling every foot of the way as he advanced,
did he manage to get away from the immediate neighborhood
of the din and rush of waters.</p>

<p>Sinking down upon his knees, he crept along for some distance
in this manner, until, as near as he could judge, he
was in a sort of valley or ravine, much broader than the one
in which he and his friends had been overwhelmed by the
flood, and which seemed to have escaped the rush of water
that had been driven through that.</p>

<p>Finding that it remained comparatively level, he finally
rose to his feet again and advanced with more speed, but at
the same time, with the caution due such a critical situation.</p>

<p>The wind was still blowing with a desolate, wailing sound,
but the rain had ceased entirely; and the night, pitchy dark
and cold, could not have been more desolate and cheerless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halloa!&#8221; suddenly exclaimed the astonished Egbert,
&#8220;yonder is a light as sure as the world! Who can be camping
out to-night? Be he friend or foe, I must find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this resolution he started toward the star-like beacon.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<h2><span>CHAPTER XXI.</span> <span class="smaller">THE LONELY CAMP-FIRE.</span></h2>

<p>The twinkling light of a camp-fire at such a time as this,
and in such a place, was enough to make any one cautious,
and Egbert Rodman approached it as stealthily as a Comanche
would have done himself.</p>

<p>He was somewhat surprised when yet some distance away
to observe that there was a single person sitting near it, in
the attitude either of deep meditation or intense listening.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be others close at hand, or else he is not
aware of the danger he runs,&#8221; muttered the young man, as he
continued his advance. &#8220;Strange, but there is something
about him that reminds me of Lightning Jo; and,&#8221; he added,
the next moment, &#8220;Lightning Jo it is; helloa! old fellow,
how came you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>And forgetful of all else for the time, except his delight
in seeing the true and tried comrade, Egbert Rodman rushed
forward to give him appropriate greeting.</p>

<p>He saw at once that something was the matter with the
scout. He was sitting upon a large stone, with his rifle between
his knees, and supporting his chin, was looking absently
into the fire, like one whose thoughts were entirely removed
from his present surroundings. He merely looked up at the
spontaneous greeting of the young friend from whom he had
become separated some time before, and staring at him for a
moment, again lowered his gaze without saying a word or
shifting his position.</p>

<p>But, if he was in a sullen, thoughtful mood, Egbert was
not, nor did he intend to keep any prolonged silence in deference
to such a whim. He believed he understood the scout
well enough to know how to approach him, and in a
cheery manner, free from any rude familiarity, he placed
himself beside him, and touching his shoulder, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Jo, don&#8217;t sit idle here. You seem to be depressed;
but rally, and tell me what the matter is.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scout seemed to appreciate the consideration shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
him, and straightening up, he heaved a great sigh, looked fixedly
at his young friend again, but still refused to speak.
Egbert was determined to press the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it that troubles you, Jo? Come, out with it;
what are you thinking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Little Lizzie Manning!</i>&#8221; was the reply of the scout, in a
voice that was sepulchral in its solemnity.</p>

<p>The shaft of a Comanche&#8217;s poisoned arrow, driven to the
heart of Egbert Rodman, could not have startled him more
than did this reply. He gave a gasp as if of pain, and almost
fell to the earth, before he could compose himself sufficiently
to sit down and collect his thoughts. When he did
so, he looked across from the opposite side of the camp-fire,
and asked, pleadingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;What about her, Jo? Is she living or dead? Can you
tell me what has become of her? Don&#8217;t keep me in suspense!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t seem in quite so much suspense a little while
ago,&#8221; he remarked, somewhat resentfully; and then, as if regretting
the words, he hastened to add, in a more considerate
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the trouble, Roddy; you know when the fresh
came, we hadn&#8217;t any time to look after each other, but we
went spinning down the kenyon as if Old Nick was arter us.
I heerd you yell, and of course you heerd my answer, but
there wasn&#8217;t much to be seen then, and so we each kept on
sailing on our own hook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Lizzie! Did you hear nothing of her?&#8221; inquired the
breathless lover.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I did hear her,&#8221; replied Jo, with another sigh;
&#8220;some time arter that I heerd her call out somebody&#8217;s
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose was it?&#8221; asked Egbert, with a painful throb of
his heart, and a staring, eager look that brought a wan smile
to the face of Jo for the instant, but passing instantly as he
made answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;As near as I could make out, it was your&#8217;n. In course
you didn&#8217;t hear it, but as I did, I called back to her, and she
know&#8217;d me on the instant. I axed her how she was fixed,
and she said she was on the back of her horse, but had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
idea where she was going, or how it was possible for her to
get out of this scrape. You can understand that it wasn&#8217;t
very easy to gabble at such a time, with the roar of the kenyon
in your ears. I told her to hang on to her hoss, no
matter where he went, and there was a chance of her getting
through somewhere. At the same time I didn&#8217;t think there
was much chance of any one ever coming out of that place
alive. I could tell by the sound of the gal&#8217;s voice that she
wasn&#8217;t very far away, and I worked as never a poor wretch
worked before to get to her. I tired my hoss out, and when
we got down to that &#8217;ere lake, or whatever you&#8217;re a mind to
call it, I struck out fer myself. The minute I left the mustang,
I sung out to her, but I didn&#8217;t hear any answer. I
yelled ag&#8217;in and ag&#8217;in, but it warn&#8217;t no use, and I swum
ashore and made up my mind&mdash;well, no&mdash;confound it,&#8221; added
the scout, fretfully, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t made up my mind, either,
that the little gal has been drowned, and we ain&#8217;t never more
to hear her sweet voice. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been feeling, and
what I was thinking about when you come sneaking up so
sly that you thought nobody could hear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think, then, that there is a possibility that she may
have escaped, after all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s the trouble,&#8221; returned Lightning Jo, with
something of his old familiar look. &#8220;When I set to thinking
about it, I can&#8217;t see any way under heaven by which she
could have come out alive, and I s&#8217;pose I couldn&#8217;t have
seen any way how you folks were ever to get out of Dead
Man&#8217;s Gulch, if I could have knowed how things were there.
It is mighty hard, and you feel it, too, if you thought half as
much of that little gal as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Egbert was inexpressibly shocked at this remark, and
looked reprovingly at the scout. He made no reply and assumed
a thoughtful attitude upon the other side of the small
camp-fire; but just then the scout roused up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound it! what&#8217;s the use! I ain&#8217;t going to make a
fool of myself! This will never do!&#8221;</p>

<p>And stretching and yawning, he suddenly raised his voice,
and emitted his peculiar yell, that rung among and through
the rocks, gorges and ravines with a power that must have
carried it a long distance over the prairie.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;What in the name of heaven do you mean by that?&#8221;
asked the astonished Rodman, suspecting that he was out of
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the poor dogs may have managed to crawl out
as did you, and that&#8217;ll tell them where to look for me.
What do you s&#8217;pose I kindled this fire for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To dry your clothes and keep the chill off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it; the night ain&#8217;t cold, and there&#8217;s nothing
in damp clothes that you or I need mind. If it hadn&#8217;t been
fur these sticks burning, you&#8217;d never have found your way
here, and it may do the same for others. No, Roddy,&#8221; said
Jo, in a more natural voice, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got nothin&#8217; to do but to
wait where we are till morning. Then we&#8217;ll take our reckoning,
and make a search for the gal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And never give up till we find her, dead or alive,&#8221; added
Egbert, in a low, earnest voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the style. I&#8217;m with you there. I s&#8217;pose you feel
a little hungry and tired?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have hardly had time to think of such a thing as hunger,
while I have become sensible of the weariness only after
seating myself here&mdash;wondering all the time how it was you
managed to have such a fire in so short a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No trouble &#8217;bout that; you see I come down ahead of all
the rest, and I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t in the basin two seconds afore I paddled
out. I&#8217;ve been in these hills so often before that I
know &#8217;em purty well, but there was a little too much darkness
for me to make out where I was. I pitched over a half-dozen
precipices something less than a mile high, and finally
lit here. It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any trouble to start a fire, as this rain was
a quick and not a soaking one. Falling right on the top of
things, it floated off, and I found all the dried leaves I wanted;
and after they was started the rest was easy enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>It came out further, that overwhelmingly sudden as was
the flood that overtook them in the canon, it had not found
Lightning Jo unprepared. His rifle was securely &#8220;corked&#8221;
at the muzzle, so as to keep out the water, and his ammunition
and a quantity of matches were all preserved in waterproof
casings, so that, barring the saturation of his garments,
he came out of the terrible bath as well as he went in.</p>

<p>True he had parted from his horse, but that cost him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
scarcely a thought. The mustang was so well trained that if
he succeeded in escaping with his own life, he would manage
to find his master with little difficulty; and, in case he had
perished, there was no dearth of animals in the West, and
there was little fear of Lightning Jo suffering long for such a
part of his outfit as a horse.</p>

<p>As Egbert saw his companion heap more fuel on the fire,
he could not avoid the thought that he was incurring great
risk thereby, as both of them were rendered the best of targets
for any skulking foe.</p>

<p>There were trees growing around, most of them of a
stunted nature&mdash;but the light of the fire could be seen for
quite a distance through the hills. The night-wind soughed
with a dull, desolate wailing, through the branches, and the
roar of the canon sounded distant and faint, growing less every
hour, and proving that it was being emptied as rapidly
as it was filled.</p>

<p>Finally Egbert Rodman could not forbear asking the question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there nothing to be feared in the shape of Indians,
Jo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; there&#8217;s none here, except&mdash;except that <i>Thing</i> that
you saw on his hoss. Didn&#8217;t I tell you that his coming was
to give us notice that something else was coming, and it was
on us afore we knowed it. It&#8217;s always so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have seen it before?&#8221; asked Egbert, who was
rather curious to hear what the scout had to say about the
creature, which certainly had caused him no little wonderment
since he had first set eyes upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think I had,&#8221; was the reply, in a hurried voice.
&#8220;It&#8217;s five years since I first heard of it, though Kit Carson
did tell me something about some such thing as that being
seen in the Apache country more than ten years ago. But
the chap that told me was the only one that was left out of
an emigrant party of over twenty. He said it come up to
their camp one night just as the sun was setting, and arter
looking at them for a few minutes rode away at a gallop, and
it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t two hours afore the red-skins was down upon
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is its appearance always the same?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I b&#8217;l&#8217;eve it is, but I ain&#8217;t sart&#8217;in. Leastways, I could
never see any thing different. It always had the blanket
thrown over it, and its head was as black as a stack of black
cats. The first time I run ag&#8217;in&#8217; it was down in the Staked
Plain, where a party of us were arter a lot of Comanches
that had made a raid on one of the settlements near the
Texan frontier. I remember there was a kind of a drizzling
rain falling and we was smoking our pipes, with our blankets
drawn up round our chins, when the critter rode down on
us, and stopped jist as he did with you. There was four of
us that blazed away at him, each one aiming at the spot
where his heart would have been had he been like other animals;
and, when his horse turned about and galloped away
with him, without his showing the least oneasiness, you can
make up your mind that we was slightly surprised. There
was several of us that heard of the Terror of the Prairie, as
he is called by some, and we concluded that this was the
gentleman, and that a row was sure to take place; so we
made ready for &#8217;em, and we had one of the tallest scrimmages
that night that any of us ever got mixed up in; but
you see we was used to that sort of business, and it wasn&#8217;t
good policy for the Terror to come down on us and tell us to
make ready. We was a little too much ready, and the red-skins
got a little more than they counted on. We riddled a
dozen of &#8217;em, and got away without losing a man or a hoss,
though most of us have got scars that were made in that
muss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; added Jo, &#8220;I won&#8217;t take time to tell all I know
&#8217;bout that critter, which ain&#8217;t much, &#8217;cept in the way he has
played the mischief round the country. I s&#8217;pose when he
took a look at you down in the gulch, it meant that he and
his folks was coming to visit you, and we got there just ahead
of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Shields seemed to know nothing about him, at
least he told nothing of what you have just described.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shields was in that party down on the Staked Plain,
and got two bullets in him, that he carries to this day: so I
reckon he does know something, arter all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he is somewhere in our neighborhood, unless he has
taken a sudden departure.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; added Lightning Jo, in a husky whisper, and with
a wild, scared look; &#8220;and he ain&#8217;t fifty feet from where
you&#8217;re setting this minute.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER XXII.</span> <span class="smaller">THOSE WHO ESCAPED.</span></h2>

<p>At this startling announcement Egbert Rodman sprung to
his feet, with a bound that carried him entirely over the fire,
striking Lightning Jo with such sudden violence as to throw
him backward almost flat upon the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in thunder is the matter?&#8221; exclaimed the scout,
laughing outright as he regained his seat; &#8220;did he prick
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man was not looking at Jo, but backward in
the gloom, in which he discerned the unmistakable outlines
of the terrible nondescript, known as the Terror of the Prairie.
It was but a glance that he gained; for, while he looked, it
began silently retreating into the gloom, like a phantom born
and sent forth by the night, and returning again to its natural
element.</p>

<p>Like a flash, Egbert raised his gun, pointed toward the
point where it had vanished, and pulled the trigger; but the
percussion exploded without firing the charge that had been
wetted, during its rush through the swollen canon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; remarked Jo, with a laugh, &#8220;it done jist as
much good as if you had fired it; so rest easy on that score.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t tell me that,&#8221; was the dogged return of Egbert,
&#8220;every living creature has some vulnerable point, and
that is no exception.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; if you want to make yourself famous jist find
the spot, and pop in a bullet there. Howsumever there always
are some folks that think they know more nor others,
and p&#8217;r&#8217;aps they do, and then p&#8217;r&#8217;aps ag&#8217;in they don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Egbert felt a little irritated at the taunting words of the
scout&mdash;which irritation was doubtless increased by the keen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
sense he had of the rather ridiculous figure he had just made;
but there was no use of showing any resentment toward
Lightning Jo; and, resuming his seat, he began withdrawing
the damaged charge from his gun. When sufficiently composed,
he asked the rather singular question:</p>

<p>&#8220;How many times do you suppose you have fired at this
thing, Jo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly; the first shot told me that it warn&#8217;t
any use; but I s&#8217;pose I&#8217;ve let fly at him a half-dozen times
more nor less, and I&#8217;ve seen five times as many balls sent after
him by others. What do you want to know that for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In all these cases did you aim at any particular portion
of the animal&mdash;his head or his body?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We always p&#8217;inted our bull-dogs at the spot where his
heart would be reached&mdash;that is, providing he had any to
reach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That proves beyond a doubt that the Terror can not be
killed in that manner. How is it that you never aimed at
his head?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lightning Jo seemed to be surprised at this question, and
stared rather wonderingly at Egbert, before he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hanged if I know what the reason is. You know it&#8217;s the
custom among us chaps to aim at the heart instead of the
head, the same as we do in a buffalo, &#8217;cause you&#8217;re surer of
wiping out the critter there than anywhere else. There&#8217;s
more than one critter that walks the airth that wouldn&#8217;t mind
a volley in the head, more than they would so many raindrops.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well then; the next time you or I shoot at him
we&#8217;ll send the bullet into his head, and then, if he don&#8217;t mind
that, I&#8217;ll be inclined to think there is something strange
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will, eh?&#8221; replied Jo, with a grunt; &#8220;that&#8217;s very
kind in you, and I hope you won&#8217;t forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you say the appearance of the Prairie Terror is always
a sure omen of coming disaster, what, in your opinion,
does its coming foretell in the present instance? What additional
calamity is about to overtake us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll l&#8217;arn that afore long; there ain&#8217;t any use trying to
find out. All I care to find out is what has become of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>Lizzie,
and as soon as the first streak of daylight comes I&#8217;m going
to find out whether she&#8217;s in the land of the living or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heart of Egbert said &#8220;<i>amen</i>&#8221; to this, and his prayer
was that the long, desolate night might hurry by, and the
opportunity come for them to do something together for unraveling
the fate of the maiden, for whom both entertained
the strongest affection.</p>

<p>Egbert, at the advice of the scout, attempted to sleep&mdash;but
he had too much on his mind to succeed in doing so. His
draggling garments did not give him special discomfort, as
the night was only moderately cool and Jo kept the fire burning
quite vigorously.</p>

<p>But between his sad forebodings of the fate of Lizzie,
whom he seemed to love with a devotion such as had
never permeated his being before, and the haunting fear of
another visit from the Terror of the Prairie, there was little
likelihood of his falling asleep.</p>

<p>The strange tales that the scout had told him of this remarkable
creature, and of his extraordinary meetings with
him, produced their effect upon Egbert, who, although of a
practical nature, with an intelligent mind, was not without a
certain imagination, peculiar to those of his age, which
made him susceptible to the influences of the time and the
place and his surroundings.</p>

<p>The roar of the rushing canon had died out entirely, and
probably that very part over which the whites, men, women
and animals, had been carried with such tremendous velocity,
was now almost entirely dry again. Through the matted,
overhanging branches Egbert caught the glimmer of several
stars, showing that the storm had cleared away entirely.
There was no moon, however, and, in the valley in which
they had encamped, the darkness was so profound as to be
absolutely impenetrable beyond the circle illuminated by the
camp-fire.</p>

<p>Young Rodman found the suspense so intolerable, that he
proposed that they should leave this spot and wander among
the hills until daylight. He believed that they would encounter
some of the survivors, and possibly might learn
something regarding Lizzie, who might be in need of the
very assistance that would thus be afforded her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>But Lightning Jo had made up his mind to remain where
he was, and no persuasion could induce him to change his
location. He declared that he could accomplish nothing by
stumbling around in the dark, while Egbert would be pretty
certain to break his neck in some of the pitfalls that were to
be encountered at every step.</p>

<p>And without attempting to depict the dismal expedients
which the wretched lover resorted to, to while away the unspeakably
dreary hours, we now hasten forward to the moment
when the unmistakable light of morning stole through
the hills, and Lightning Jo, springing to his feet, declared
that the moment had come when the terrible suspense was to
end, and they were soon to learn the worst that had happened
to the party and to the one dear one&mdash;Lizzie Manning.</p>

<p>The first point toward which the two directed their steps
was the canon, through which they had had their memorable
passage. This was but a short distance away, and, upon
being reached, it was found as they had anticipated, entirely
clear of running water. Here and there were muddy, stagnant
pools collected in the hollows and cavities, but nothing
of any living person, or animal, or <i>debris</i> of wagons, was discerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had we not better descend and follow the canon to the
outlet?&#8221; asked Egbert. &#8220;We shall not miss any thing then
on the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lightning Jo acted upon the suggestion, and after a little
searching for a safe means of descent, the bottom was reached,
and they pursued their way in silence, agitated by strange
emotions, as they recalled the memorable experience of a few
nights before.</p>

<p>They walked side by side, neither breaking the impressive
stillness by a word, but carefully scanning every foot of
ground passed in quest of some remnant of those who had
been their companions in the terrible descent.</p>

<p>Suddenly the scout pointed to a wagon-wheel that was
driven in between two jutting points of rocks, where it had
been immovably fixed by the tremendous momentum.</p>

<p>Both scanned it a few minutes, and, seeing nothing more,
passed on for fully a quarter of a mile, when the basin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
which reference has been made was reached, and here a great
surprise awaited them.</p>

<p>It being quite shallow, the water had been carried away by
several outlets, and not a man had been borne beyond.
Fragments of the wagons were scattered in every direction,
and at one side of the dry lake were to be seen Captain
Shields, Gibbons and a number of the men covering up a
large grave, while seated around were several women with
their children, as miserable and desolate-looking objects as
could possibly be imagined.</p>

<p>Not having dared to hope that so many could have escaped,
the two paused in mute silence and stared at them, their
looks after the first startling shock being directed in anxious
quest of <i>the one</i>&mdash;Lizzie Manning&mdash;a look that was unrewarded
by a sight of the beautiful maiden, for whom both were
ready to do and dare any thing.</p>

<p>Still hoping that she might be somewhere in the vicinity,
they hurried forward and put the all-important question.</p>

<p>Sad to say, no living person had seen her or knew aught
regarding her.</p>

<p>And then their own sad story was told. All, of course,
had been hurried irresistibly into this basin&mdash;some bruised,
and almost senseless. Three of the men were killed, and
also a mother and her two children. The ghastly cargo of
the wagon, containing the remains of those who had fallen
in the fight in Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch, was also there. The soldiers,
who had charge of the women and children, clung
bravely to them, and the shallowness of the water enabling
the horses to touch bottom almost immediately, they were
not long in floundering out upon dry land, where the miserable
group huddled together until the coming of day should
enable them to see where they were, and to do what was
possible for themselves.</p>

<p>When the dawn of light showed them the dreadful number
of inanimate bodies, their first proceeding was to give
them a decent burial, as it was out of the question to think
of taking them to Fort Adams after the destruction of the
wagons. And so, from the contents of the wagons, lying
everywhere, they gathered up a half-dozen shovels, and as
many men went to work with such a vigor and skill that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
a few minutes a large, shallow grave was dug, and into this
all were tenderly placed and covered up from mortal sight,
all shedding tears of the deepest sorrow over the terrible
death that had been decreed by inexorable fate.</p>

<p>While they were thus employed, others were absent among
the hills in quest of the mustangs, and Jo and Egbert had
exchanged but a few words with their friends, when they
began coming in with the animals, that were all browsing at
no great distance.</p>

<p>Their purpose was to mount the horses as speedily as possible,
and to make all haste to Fort Adams. The women
and children were in a deplorable condition and needed care
and a rest of several days before continuing their journey to
Santa Fe.</p>

<p>When this proposal was mentioned to Lightning Jo, he
indorsed it at once, telling them to lose not a moment.
They had not a particle of eatable food in their possession,
and it was extremely difficult to procure any in these hills,
which, rather singularly, were known to have been for years
almost entirely devoid of game of any description. Consequently,
as nothing at all was to be gained by remaining
here, the dictate of prudence was that they should depart at
the very moment they could make ready.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, Lizzie Manning was among the
first that was missed by the group that huddled on the banks
of the basin, and so great was the concern regarding her
that during the darkness Captain Shields and two of the men
groped around the neighborhood in quest of her, calling her
name and searching along the shore of the basin for hours.
The search was made more extended and thorough, when
they had the daylight at their command, but it resulted in an
entire failure. Not the least trace was gained, either of her
or of the horse which she was known to be riding.</p>

<p>One of the men who had helped to bring in the mustangs
took occasion to tell Lightning Jo, in a confidential way, that
he had detected signs of Indians, and he believed there was
quite a number among the hills, and that it was impossible
that they should know nothing of the presence of the whites
so near them.</p>

<p>This information surprised the scout and caused him no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
little uneasiness. He questioned the soldier closely, and became
convinced that he was right, and that the whole company
were in great danger of attack. Under these circumstances,
he took it in hand himself, and told them all of the
urgency of haste in reaching their destination.</p>

<p>Scarcely fifteen minutes had passed when every man was
upon his mustang, and the females, with their offspring, were
distributed among them. Lightning Jo and Egbert Rodman
placed themselves at their head, and the scout cautiously led
the way through another narrow pass for something like a
quarter of a mile, when they reached the open prairie once
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now go,&#8221; he added, &#8220;and never pause or look back
until you ride into the stockade of Fort Adams.&#8221;</p>

<p>And his advice was taken and followed almost to the letter;
but, even then it is impossible to imagine whether they
would have succeeded in reaching the shelter after all without
being harassed by the Comanches, but for the fact that
ere they had gone three miles they met a party of rescue
sent out by Colonel Cleaves, who had become alarmed at their
failure to come in during the night. Under the escort of
this powerful company of cavalry, the journey was completed
in safety, and we now bid them good-by at the friendly fort
and turn our attention to those in whom we have a more immediate interest.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER XXIII.</span> <span class="smaller">COMANCHE HONOR.</span></h2>

<p>With the departure of Captain Shields and his party,
Lightning Jo and Egbert Rodman set about the task of trailing
the missing maiden, if such a proceeding lay within the
range of human possibility.</p>

<p>There was something strange and mysterious in this failure
upon the part of all to discover any traces of her or
her horse. Had both or either of them been dead, this
scarcely could have been the case. Every member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
party, excepting herself, had been accounted for, and was
either buried in the quiet grave among the hills or else was
within the stockade of Fort Adams, beyond the reach of the
Comanches in the South-west.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can she be?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the question that the two men put to each other
and to themselves a score of times in as many minutes, and
to which no satisfactory answer could be given. All was
conjecture, and even that was of the most vague nature.</p>

<p>Lightning Jo had very little to say, but he was in deep
thought as he moved morbidly about, with his eyes upon the
ground, seeking out some clue by which he might take up
the hunt for Lizzie, with some slight probability at least of
success.</p>

<p>There were two facts which were constantly recurring to
Egbert Rodman, and which caused him an apprehension positively
tormenting. The Terror of the Prairie had been seen
by himself and Lightning Jo but a few hours before, at no
great distance from where they were standing at that moment,
and he could not avoid connecting this with the disappearance
of the maiden. Precisely in what way, it was hard for
him to define, but he was convinced beyond a doubt that the
two bore some relation to each other.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the declaration of Lightning Jo that the appearance
of this nondescript boded coming calamity might
be said to have been verified in the present instance; for
quickly on the heels of its vanishment came the knowledge
of the disappearance of Lizzie and the presence of Comanches
in these hills, proving the closeness of the connection between
the two. The loss of the maiden to whom his heart
clung with such yearning devotion was certainly the greatest
calamity that had as yet befallen young Rodman, and he involuntarily
shuddered as he recalled that awful ride down
the canon, followed as it had been in the case of Lizzie by
some after experience, that was all the more appalling to her
friends, inasmuch as they knew nothing positive of its nature
and could only indulge in the wildest conjecture.</p>

<p>The only thing that afforded any thing like relief or consolation
to the lover was the fact that he had the companionship
and assistance of Lightning Jo in this search. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>Whatever
was possible to be done for her rescue and safety by
mortal man would be done by this wonderful scout, who was
already busy making ready, and fully satisfying himself before
he fairly started to work in the matter.</p>

<p>Every thing indicated that the two men could not remain
long in these hills&mdash;for, aside from the fact that the demands
of hunger could not be postponed for a much longer period,
the probability began to present itself, that the girl was also
gone from the vicinity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you not think it likely,&#8221; inquired Egbert, when his
comrade paused for a moment, &#8220;that when she emerged
from the basin, as she did do, that she has managed to reach
some hiding-place among the rocks, where she still remains&mdash;perhaps
asleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>This possibility seemed to have been entertained already
by the scout, who instantly shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she&#8217;d have done that, some of the boys would have
come across her hoss, for he would have managed to get himself
into the company of the other mustangs, and would have
been seen by them, in looking for the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there are our own animals yet; we have seen nothing
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the boys did; they told me they see&#8217;d &#8217;em both, and
I&#8217;ll have my critter in sight in less&#8217;n two minutes; see if I
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he uttered a low, quavering whistle, not very
loud, but sufficiently so to be heard a distance of several
hundred yards. Then pausing a moment he repeated the
signal in precisely the same manner, and added, in his
way:</p>

<p>&#8220;That animal will be here, if he&#8217;s got forty Comanches trying
to hold him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wish I could recover mine so easily,&#8221; laughed Egbert,
as the scout composedly sat down upon a large stone to
await the coming of his faithful mustang, &#8220;but I am afraid
Mahomet must go to the mountain in my case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I parted company with mine last night, the understanding
was that he was to go off and hunt a little something
to eat on his own hook, and he expected to be told
when I wanted him.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;And knowing that he will obey like an obedient child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly&mdash;there he comes this minute,&#8221; replied Jo, as the
tread of some animal was heard but a short distance away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, Jo, that it is nothing else,&#8221; warned Egbert, stepping
back, so as to give the scout free room for whatever
might come.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know his footstep,&#8221; was the response to this, accompanied
at the same time by a precautionary movement, consisting
in the guide raising the hammer of his rifle and bringing
it to the front, where he could discharge it, if necessary,
with the quickness of lightning, posing himself at the same
time upon one foot, so as to be prepared to leap forward or
backward as the case might be.</p>

<p>This precaution had scarcely been taken, when the mustang
of Lightning Jo put in an appearance, accompanied by a Comanche
Indian, who, sitting astride of the sagacious beast,
was in blissful ignorance of whither he was being carried.</p>

<p>His position was the quiet one of ease and self-possession,
showing that he had no thought of any impending danger.
From this fancied security he was awakened by the sight of
Lightning Jo, standing scarcely a dozen feet away, with his
rifle pointed full at his breast.</p>

<p>The mustang at a word from his master stopped short, and
thus the red-skin was brought face to face with the man,
whom he recognized on the instant as the most deadly foe of
the Comanche race.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get off that hoss, you old galoot! he belongs to me.
Slide mighty quick or I&#8217;ll slide you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The substance of this was uttered in the Comanche tongue,
so as to make sure of its being understood, and the action of
the red-skin demonstrated that he had no difficulty in comprehending
it on the instant; for he slid off the back of the
mustang as suddenly and nimbly as if it had all at once become
red-hot beneath him.</p>

<p>The savage held a long, beautiful rifle in his hand, and he
was evidently on the alert, either for a chance to use it or to
dodge away from his captor.</p>

<p>Had the circumstances been any different, the marvelous
quickness of the copper-skin doubtless would have enabled
him to accomplish his treacherous wish; but neither he nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
any living Indian could play it on Lightning Jo. If he
thought he could, let him try it&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>The scout wasn&#8217;t particular whether he made the attempt
or not, as there could be but one result; but the moment the
Comanche&#8217;s feet touched ground, he ordered him to approach
within a half-dozen feet, and then drop his rifle to the earth.
The red-skin showed some reluctance in obeying this; but
when he caught the glitter of the dark eye fixed upon him,
he changed his mind and carried out the command with an
amusing alacrity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the rest of you devils?&#8221; was the first rather
pointed inquiry, uttered also in the Comanche tongue, and
with the muzzle of the rifle pointed threateningly at the
breast of the savage, who replied, with a gesture peculiarly
his own:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are but a few among the hills&mdash;no more than so
many (holding up the fingers of one hand); they are hunting
for food; they will soon take their departure to join their
brother-hunters far to the south.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a thundering sight better if they&#8217;d all join
each other down below,&#8221; was the conclusion of Jo, who continued
his cross-examination:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have any gone away in the night? Did any of the Comanches
depart before daybreak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; there were none here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The slight hesitancy, a certain peculiarity that accompanied
this reply, convinced Jo, on the instant, that the Indian was
telling a downright falsehood, and that, after all, he was gaining
a slight clue to the trail of the missing maiden.</p>

<p>His conclusion was that there were a few Indians among
the hills, but that the greater majority had left before daybreak.
Precisely why they had done so was more than he
could understand; but their departure unquestionably had
something to do with the disappearance of Lizzie Manning.</p>

<p>Jo was rather abrupt in his questioning, for the next was
the pointed demand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me where the great chief, Swico-Cheque, is; I want
to raise his hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>The look that crossed the coppery face of the savage said
as plainly as words could have done, that he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
been extremely delighted to see the scout attempt such a
thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where he is,&#8221; he replied, without any embarrassment
in his manner; &#8220;he went away before the light
came.&#8221;</p>

<p>There it was! the incautious Indian had let it out after all.
Swico-Cheque had taken his departure with the band that
went off in the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>The red-skin seemed entirely unaware of the slip he had
made, and awaited the further questioning of his captor as
the heroic martyr awaits the creeping up of the consuming
blaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as I want any thing more of you,&#8221; remarked
the scout, &#8220;so I guess you can travel. It would be hardly
the thing to scalp you after I look you prisoner, though I&#8217;m
sure you deserve it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This order was unexpected and surprising to the Indian,
who stared a moment, as if uncertain that he had heard
aright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, &#8217;light out of this, old greaser!&#8221; added Jo, the next
instant.</p>

<p>This was all-sufficient. The Comanche stooped down, and
picking up his rifle, turned about with a certain dignity and
walked slowly away, disdaining to run, although no doubt
anxious to get out of that immediate neighborhood with as
little delay as possible.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span>CHAPTER XXIV.</span> <span class="smaller">A DESPERATE HOPE.</span></h2>

<p>It was not the nature of Lightning Jo to remain idle when
he had any work like the present on hand, and leaping upon
the back of his mustang, he told Egbert to follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to ride and make you walk,&#8221; he laughed;
&#8220;we haven&#8217;t started yet, but are only making ready. Come
along.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rode scarcely a hundred yards through the roughest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
part of the hills, when he dismounted in a dense mass of undergrowth,
and, without fastening his mustang, said a few
words to him, which would insure his remaining where he
was until his return, by which time Jo was quite confident
that he could secure an animal also for Egbert, as it was indispensable
that he should have one at once.</p>

<p>When it was certain that there were Indians in the immediate
vicinity, the greatest caution was necessary upon the
part of our two friends, and Lightning Jo made his way
through the ravines, gorges and hills, with as much circumspection
as if he were reconnoitering a Comanche camp.
When he halted, they were on the very summit of one of the
highest peaks of this spur of mountains, which afforded them
a most extensive view of the surrounding prairie.</p>

<p>Glancing at Jo, Egbert saw that he was looking off to the
westward, with an attentive, searching look that indicated
something; and, as he did not remove his gaze from that
point, he imitated him, straining his vision to the utmost.</p>

<p>The young man had looked but a moment, when he detected
a party of horsemen moving in a southwesterly direction.
They were so far away that it was impossible to
identify them; but there was scarcely a doubt of their being
Indians, and most probably the very ones for whom Lightning
Jo was searching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see them, do you?&#8221; was the question of Jo, as
he looked around and started to move away. &#8220;I s&#8217;pose you
know &#8217;em, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suspect that they are Indians; but I conclude that not
from any certain knowledge of my own, but simply infer it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; they&#8217;re the Comanches that left the hills before
daylight. Swico-Cheque, the biggest red devil that walks
the earth, is at their head. He&#8217;s got enough of butting his
head ag&#8217;in&#8217; United States soldiers, and he&#8217;s off to recruit his
health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what of her&mdash;of Lizzie?&#8221; asked Egbert, in a trembling
voice, dreading to hear the answer that he was almost
sure would come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, she&#8217;s with him, of course. He&#8217;ll keep her till he
gets tired of her, and then he&#8217;ll have some more fringe for
his hunting-shirt.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>
<p>These words were uttered in the very desperation of vengefulness,
and the scout wheeled about with a spiteful air, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay here till I come back! If you see any of the infarnal
copper-skins, bore a hole through &#8217;em. If you see anybody,
break his head! Look out for yourself! keep cautious,
and rest easy till I come back. I won&#8217;t be gone long.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this rather contradictory advice, Lightning Jo
wheeled about, plunged down the hill, and was gone almost
on the instant.</p>

<p>He had been gone but a short time, when the near crack
of a rifle broke the stillness, and Egbert started and looked
around, thinking that, perhaps, some treacherous Comanche
had stolen up and sent a bullet after him; but he
could see nothing, and he concluded that Lightning Jo had
something to do with the discharge of the gun, as, indeed, it
seemed to have a certain familiar sound.</p>

<p>But little time was given him for speculation when the
scout himself put in an appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Roddy,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found your hoss; we&#8217;re
ready now; and there&#8217;s no use in waiting longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you find him?&#8221; asked Egbert, not a little surprised
and delighted at the unexpected news.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a red-skin on him; he ain&#8217;t there now, and I
guess won&#8217;t bother us more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough, a few rods away, the identical steed which
Egbert had ridden from Dead Man&#8217;s Gulch was found secured
to a bush, and, leaping upon his back, it required but a few
minutes for the two comrades to reach the spot where the
faithful mustang of Lightning Jo was awaiting the return of
his master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, let us get out of this infernal place,&#8221; added the
scout, as the two reined up their animals, side by side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whither do we direct our course?&#8221; asked Egbert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Straight after them devils, and we&#8217;re never to stop till we
cotch up with Swico, and him and me square up our accounts.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little care and patience, and in a few minutes the two
horsemen found themselves upon the edge of the prairie, and
they headed due west, straight in the path taken by Swico-Cheque
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>and his band, and the mustangs were instantly put to
a full run.</p>

<p>About the middle of the forenoon, when the heroic Egbert
felt that he was taxing himself beyond his strength, they
struck a deserted camp, where a party of United States cavalry,
ranging through the country upon a scout, had spent
the previous night. Here were found the remains and fragments
of their meal scattered all about, and it gave to both,
what they so much needed&mdash;a nourishing, substantial meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, straightening up like a giant refreshed with
new wine, &#8220;I am ready for any thing, I don&#8217;t care what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;ll get enough of it afore long,&#8221; was the significant
reply of Lightning Jo, adding, &#8220;we&#8217;re close onto the
copper-skins, and if I ain&#8217;t mistook more than I ever was in
my life, we&#8217;ll strike their camp inside of an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was startling news, but was singularly verified; for
scarcely a half-hour had passed when the scout, who was riding
a short distance in advance, ascended a small swell of the
prairie and almost the instant he reached the top, wheeled his
mustang about and galloped back again, motioning to Egbert
to do the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve reached their camp,&#8221; he said, in explanation, and
cautioning the bewildered man to resist every temptation to
stir a foot from the spot until his return, the scout moved up
the prairie-swell again. Egbert saw him crouch down like a
panther about to leap upon its prey, and then he vanished
from view as noiselessly as a shadow, leaving the lover to
the trying task of waiting, fearing, hoping, watching, listening,
and to despair. Lightning Jo passed down the opposite side
of the swell, and, as was his custom in reconnoitering the
camp of a foe, he made a circuitous route by a small cluster
of stunted trees, which struck him as offering the very shelter
he so much needed.</p>

<p>He had no thought of any of his foes being here, but he
had scarcely approached the margin when he became certain
that he was close upon one or more of them.</p>

<p>In his stealthy manner he insinuated himself among the
trees, and the next instant was greeted with the sight of the
great Comanche chieftain, Swico-Cheque, reclining upon the
ground in a sound slumber!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<h2><span>CHAPTER XXV.</span> <span class="smaller">AT LAST.</span></h2>

<p>Yes; there lay the great Comanche chieftain, Swico-Cheque,
sunk into a heavy slumber&mdash;deep and profound&mdash;and
yet of that character which would have required but the
slightest noise to awake.</p>

<p>Lightning Jo paused in his creeping, stealthy movement,
and stared at the savage, his own eyes gleaming with an
exultation as ferocious as would have been that of the red-skin
himself, had their relative positions been changed. The
murderous and outrageous crimes of which this fiend had
been guilty, his relentless war upon unoffending whites, his
scores of murders of weak, defenseless women, and even the
nursing babe, had placed him outside the pale of human mercy,
and there was not a settler or soldier in the South-west who
knew of his revolting character that did not feel that he deserved
to be strangled to death, or put out of the way by any
means that happened to present itself.</p>

<p>He had on, this moment, the very hunting-shirt to which
reference has been made, fringed around with a broad band
of human hair, from the long, dark, flowing tresses of the innocent
virgin, to the light, silvery locks of prattling childhood.
And his seamed face, daubed and smirched with paint,
had the horrid look of that of some sleeping gorilla that had
been feasting upon its human meal.</p>

<p>And yet in this moment of triumph, when Jo felt that he
had him at last, there came a strange feeling to the scout,
which can be understood, perhaps, by his whispered exclamations
to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound it! it will look as if I was afeard of him, when
I shouldn&#8217;t like any thing better than to have a fair stand-up
fight. He might keep all the knives he wanted, and I would
use nothing but my fists. How I should like to play some
trick upon the infernal skunk!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ay! at this very time, when he had every thing to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
him serious and thoughtful, there came a strange reaction
over Jo, and an irresistible desire to play one of his practical
jokes upon the Comanche. He concluded to wake him up
to witness his own demise&mdash;but to arouse him in an original
fashion.</p>

<p>It was a delicate task; but with that skill for which the
scout was noted, he drew out his flask and poured out a
stream of powder, moving the flask along from a point on the
ground directly beside the Comanche&#8217;s ear, for several feet
away&mdash;the particles all being united, so that the connection
was perfect. Then, when every thing was safe, Jo drew a
lucifer from the little safe he always carried about him, and
struck it upon the bottom of his foot. As it ignited he held
the blaze close to the black grains, and then spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Swico, my own loved cherub&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>This was enough; these words were barely uttered, when
his snaky eyes opened, just in time to see a serpentine line of
fire rushing toward him, and going off in a big puff directly
under his ear, in a way that scorched his face and caused him
to leap to his feet, with a howl, followed by an instant rush
out from among the trees. He had caught a glimpse of his
old enemy through the whizzing, and he was gone like a
shot.</p>

<p>This was unexpected by Jo, who had hoped that he would
maintain his ground, and the two would have fought out their
fight on the spot. He did not anticipate any such flight as
this, which was made so suddenly that he had no time to interfere
ere he was gone.</p>

<p>The scout had the intense chagrin, also, of feeling that his
propensity for waggery had led into a piece of foolishness
that most likely would militate against the captive Lizzie.
Knowing that she had one friend, at least, so near at hand,
they would be sure to adopt greater precautions, and instead
of waiting to be attacked by Lightning Jo, would, most probably,
attack him.</p>

<p>And acting upon this supposition, he backed out as speedily
as possible, and resumed his circuitous approach to the
camp-fire of the Comanches&mdash;the locality of which up to this
time, he had been able to determine only by the smoke that
rose from the opposite side of a small ridge several rods away.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>But the chief, Swico-Cheque, suspecting that a large party
of United States cavalry were upon his heels, concluded
that the safest plan for him was to get away with as little
delay as possible, to accomplish which he sent back several
of his warriors to dispose of Lightning Jo, and to keep the
rest in check until he could secure his retreat with his prize.</p>

<p>Consequently the scout had stolen along over the broken
ground but a rod or two when he found himself face to face
with a couple of herculean warriors, who, approaching the
cluster of trees in the same cautious manner, encountered the
great Indian-fighter sooner than was anticipated by either
party.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good!&#8221; exclaimed Jo, &#8220;for now I will get warmed
up to business. I&#8217;ll try a left-hander straight from the
shoulder upon this chap, and a right upon t&#8217;other.&#8221;</p>

<p>The terrific blows were simultaneous with the conclusion,
the startled red-skins turning back summersets upon the
ground, where, with an incredible celerity, the frightful bowie-knife,
which Jo whipped out from behind his neck, completed
the ghastly work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t there any more?&#8221; he growled, glaring like a wild
beast thirsting for prey. &#8220;By heavens, if they don&#8217;t come
to me, I&#8217;ll go to them!&#8221;</p>

<p>And he was striding directly toward the camp of the Comanches,
but, ere he could advance half-way, who should
leap into view but young Egbert Rodman, his face white and
scared, and panting from excitement and the great exertions
he had made to find his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jo! there&#8217;s something wrong!&#8221; he gasped; &#8220;the Comanches
are fooling us both, and we shall not get Lizzie after
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up? What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; demanded the scout,
his muscles all aquiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are retreating; I heard the tramp of their horses&#8217;
feet on the other side the ridge, and, oh, heavens! Jo, I heard
the moans of a woman&mdash;it must have been Lizzie&mdash;and that
set my brain on fire, and scarcely knowing what I did I left
both the horses and rushed to the ridge&mdash;but they were gone;
I could see nothing of them, and then I turned to hunt for
you. In God&#8217;s name, can we do nothing?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<p>Scarcely giving his companion time to finish his words, and
vouchsafing no reply, Lightning Jo shot over the hill like an
arrow, straight in the path of the fleeing Comanches. He did
not pause to leap upon the back of his own mustang; he had
no time for that.</p>

<p>Down the hollow, between the ridges, he shot like a thunderbolt.
His practiced eye saw on the ground around him
the prints of the horses&#8217; flying feet, and he knew that he was
on the right track. Still he saw nothing of them&mdash;but look!
Six horsemen on a full gallop were seen thundering over the
ridge in a direction at right-angles to the one he was pursuing&mdash;fleeing
as they supposed from three times their number,
but in reality from a single man.</p>

<p>The excited scout could not avoid giving out his wild,
peculiar yell, as he recognized among the half-dozen the
chieftain Swico, and saw that he held in his black arms the
beautiful Lizzie Manning.</p>

<p>The Comanches heard that strange yell, and identified it.
Only one living man could give utterance to that frightful
cry, and once heard it could never be forgotten. They
glanced over their shoulders and saw the single man bearing
down upon them; but they continued their headlong flight,
and the next moment were shut out, for the time, from view
by the interposing ridge over which they had just passed.</p>

<p>No doubt they believed that the single scout, rushing down
upon them at such terrific speed, had a whole company upon
his heels, and they could not pause, just then, for the delightful
privilege of killing such a noted enemy as he.</p>

<p>Lightning Jo kept on down the hollow, following a course
at right-angles to the one taken by the Comanches, until he
reached the point where they had gone over, when he bounded
up the declivity, expecting to come up with them the next
minute.</p>

<p>As he did so he was met by the discharge of two rifles&mdash;one
of the bullets striking him in the fleshy part of the thigh;
but although the sting instantly warned him of what had
taken place, he did not pause or even look down to see how
serious was the wound, but he made straight for the Indians,
who were now in full view again.</p>

<p>But hold! what meant that which he now saw? Instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of six, there were but five Comanches, and a glance sufficed
to show that the missing one was Swico-Cheque, with the
maid.</p>

<p>By what means had he disappeared in such a sudden and
mysterious manner?</p>

<p>The moment Lightning Jo became aware of the state of
things he paused. His experienced eye told him that the
Comanche must have made another turn, the instant he
passed over the ridge, leaving his comrades and taking a
course precisely opposite to that of the scout, so that indeed
the two actually met, with the back of the ridge shutting
out each from the view of the other.</p>

<p>One sweep of his eagle eye was sufficient to tell Jo this, and
he made straight for the stunted trees, somewhat similar to
those in which he had first met him, certain that Swico was
either among them, or fleeing beyond.</p>

<p>The correctness of this conclusion was verified the next
moment, by a glimpse of the red devil, with his horse still
under full speed, fleeing up the hollow beyond the clump of
trees, apparently with every prospect of making good his escape.</p>

<p>Jo was through the clump of trees in an instant, and then,
as he found himself gaining rapidly, he gave out his panther-like
yell. The Comanche, who was no more than a hundred
yards distant, managed to turn in his saddle, and pointed his
rifle at the scout, who did the same.</p>

<p>But the treacherous red-skin, with a cowardice peculiarly
his own, forced the form of Lizzie Manning directly in front
of him, like a shield, and succeeded in screening himself in
such a way that Jo found he was as likely to strike the one as
the other.</p>

<p>In this strait it only remained for the scout to attempt to
escape the bullet, and he made a lightning-like leap to one
side; marvelous as was his quickness, it could not equal that
of a rifle-ball, and he was struck.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shan&#8217;t escape me yet,&#8221; hissed Jo, as he dashed in
with the purpose of drawing the Comanche from his horse,
and finishing him with his knife.</p>

<p>With superhuman energy he passed fully one-half the intervening
distance, ere the startled Swico could urge his steed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
forward again, and then he dropped like a shot to the
earth.</p>

<p>Even then he would not yield&mdash;but with an amazing power
of will, rolled over on his face, and rose on his uninjured
knee. In this position he raised his rifle again; but the malignant
Comanche had his eye upon him, and the same instant
the fainting form of the girl was whirled around in his front,
and the infuriated scout, who, for an instant, had meditated
shooting both, finding himself baffled at every point, dropped
back again in despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use; I may as well go under,&#8221; he muttered, giving
up entirely.</p>

<p>The exulting Comanche, still fearful of the wounded man&#8217;s
rifle, rode on, intending to return at his leisure and scalp the
man who had been so long such an effective foe.</p>

<p>But his career was at an end. He was still looking at the
prostrate form of the scout, when the near crack of a rifle
broke the stillness, and the great Comanche chieftain, Swico-Cheque,
rolled from his mustang, shot through the heart!</p>

<p>In his fall he dragged Lizzie Manning with him, and he
would have slain her in his dying moments, had he not been
killed as instantly as if stricken by a bolt from heaven.</p>

<p>The maiden, rallying to a sense of her terrible position,
tore herself loose, and the next moment was caught in the
arms of Egbert Rodman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God! thank God!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he pressed
her to his heart; &#8220;saved at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>She joined her murmurs of thanksgiving with his, and then
with a noble sympathy characteristic of her, she raised her
head, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Jo is hurt; and I&#8217;m afraid he is killed! Let us go
to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two hurried down the hollow where the scout lay as
motionless as if dead; but he roused up when he saw them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty badly hurt,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but if I can call my
hoss here, I think I can ride him to the fort. You&#8217;d better
get that one yonder for the gal. Bless your heart! I&#8217;m glad
to see you alive,&#8221; he added, with a kindly light beaming in
his dark eyes. &#8220;I say, Roddy, help me down to where that
red-skin lays. I want to take a look at him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>Lightning Jo made the signal to his mustang, and then, almost
carried by his friend, he was helped to where the stiffening
body of Swico-Cheque lay stretched upon the earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t scalp him,&#8221; muttered the scout, as he looked at
him, &#8220;&#8217;cause he can&#8217;t see it, but I&#8217;ll take charge of that fancy
dress of his, and send it to Washington for the Peace Commissioners
to look at.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this was done.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1"> [A]</a></p>

<p>A few minutes later, the mustang of Lightning Jo came
trotting over the ridge, followed by the horse of Egbert.
With considerable care the wounded scout was placed upon
it; Lizzie mounted the Indian horse, and the three instantly
started on their journey to Fort Adams, which was reached
without any incident worthy of mention. The other ladies
were found just preparing to start for Santa Fe under a
strong escort. Egbert and Lizzie joined them, after being
assured by the surgeon of the fort that the wounds of Lightning
Jo were not of a serious nature, and barring accidents,
he was sure soon to recover his usual strength and activity
again.</p>

<p>Tried in the fire, as were the two lovers, the bond of love
was so deepened and purified, that nothing could occur to
weaken and mar it; and when, some months later, the handsome
couple were united in Santa Fe&mdash;the jolliest guest of all,
and the one in most general favor, was Lightning Jo, who
had a story to tell the young husband and wife when he
gained the first opportunity to see them alone. This story
was nothing more nor less than the clearing up of the mystery
of the Terror of the Prairie, as he had learned it from a
Comanche prisoner brought into the fort. This noted creature
and Swico-Cheque, the Comanche chief, were the same.
It was a ruse of the sagacious red-skin by which he obtained
any desired knowledge of a party he intended to attack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Well aware of the superstitious nature of the bordermen, he
blackened his face in a fantastic manner, wrapped several
thick blankets about his body. These were bullet-proof, and
although he incurred great risk of being killed, and was
wounded more than once, yet it was left for Egbert Rodman
to fire the bullet, that killed Swico-Cheque, the Terror of the
Prairie, and at the same time gained him his lovely wife.</p>

death. A shirt of buck-skin, made without the usual ornamentation of
beads and porcupine quills, yet graced with something quite novel in the
decorative way&mdash;a full, long fringe, <i>formed of the hair of white women
and children</i>. It was a ghastly adornment&mdash;indeed, the entire garment
was a very unpleasant thing to inspect. The only point in it on which the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
